%\subsection{Higher-Order Session Calculi}
\noi 
This paper is about \emph{relative expressiveness} results for 
\emph{higher-order process calculi}, core programming languages that 
integrate name- and process-passing in communications.
We focus on calculi coupled with \emph{session types} that denote interaction protocols. 
%The expressivity relations that we aim to are essential for the transference of reasoning techniques, notably behavioral equivalences, across different typed languages. 
%Our motivation for studying expressivity relations is to establish a firm foundation for the transference of reasoning techniques, notably behavioral equivalences, across different session typed languages. 
%Our results %of relative expressiveness 
%enable us to identify 
Our goal is to identify
a \emph{core %process language % concurrency %with session primitives, 
calculus}
that encompasses both first- and higher-order session communication.
%equally expressive as several other
%calculi with sessions.
%\emph{essential} constructs, i.e., constructs those not expressible in terms of other constructs. 
%They are also central ingredients in the   \emph{transference of reasoning techniques}, notably behavioral theories, across different languages.
Establishing expressiveness results 
in our typed setting 
is challenging because 
%Since session types denote protocols, 
 it entails defining 
 not only a translation 
relating source and target languages (\emph{encoding}), but also a translation 
relating their associated session types. 
We aim at a very particular class of correct encodings: namely \emph{fully abstract} and \emph{type-preserving} encodings.
%This is a challenging task, as we elaborate next.
In the following, we elaborate on our aims,   approach, and contributions.

\jparagraph{Context}
In \emph{session-based concurrency}, concurrent interactions are organized into \emph{sessions}, basic communication units.
Interaction patterns can then be abstracted as expressive \emph{session types}~\cite{honda.vasconcelos.kubo:language-primitives}, against which process specifications may be checked. 
%These patterns are defined as %(possibly recursive) 
%sequences of communication actions: % (send/receive a value, offer/select a behavior).
%For instance, 
%session type $T_1 = \btinp{\mathsf{str}} \btout{\mathsf{int}}  \tinact$ may be intuitively read as: receive (?) a value of type $\mathsf{str}$,then output (!) a value of type $\mathsf{int}$, finally close the protocol.
Session type $\btinp{U} S$ (resp.  $\btout{U} S$)
describes a protocol that first receives (resp. sends) a value of type $U$ and then continues as protocol $S$.
Also, given an index set $I$, types $\btbra{l_i:S_i}_{i \in I}$ 
and $\btsel{l_i:S_i}_{i \in I}$ 
define %, respectively,
%a branching and selection constructs for  
 a labeled choice mechanism; types 
$\trec{t}{S}$ 
and 
$\tinact$ denote recursive and completed protocols, respectively.
%describes a protocol that offers
%(resp. ) 
%Type $\tinact$ denotes the completed protocol.
In the (first-order) $\pi$-calculus~\cite{MilnerR:calmp1}, 
session types describe the intended interactive behavior of the names/channels in a process.
%names/channels are endowed with session types (such as $T_1$) representing their intended interactive behavior.
Session-based concurrency has also been casted in \emph{higher-order} process
calculi which, by combining features from the $\lambda$-calculus and the $\pi$-calculus, 
enable the exchange of values that may contain processes~\cite{tlca07,DBLP:journals/jfp/GayV10}. 
Besides offering a natural bridge between concurrent and functional computation, 
higher-order calculi with sessions enable the specification of protocols involving \emph{code mobility}, 
frequent in practice.
In the main higher-order session language  studied here (denoted \HOp),
 values in communications include names but also (first-order) abstractions---functions from name identifiers to processes. 
 %(In contrast, higher-order abstractions---functions from processes to processes---are disallowed.)
 (In contrast, we rule out functions from processes to processes, i.e., higher-order abstractions.)
Abstractions can be linear or shared; their types are  denoted $\lhot{C}$ and $\shot{C}$, respectively ($C$ 
%is a first-order type $C$ (say, a session name).
denotes a name). We may have a 
session type such as, e.g.,
%$T_2 = \btbra{upload:\btinp{\lhot{\mathsf{int}}}\tinact ~ , ~ sha:\btinp{\shot{\mathsf{int}}}\tinact}_{}$
$$S = \btbra{up:\btinp{\lhot{C}}\btout{\mathsf{ok}}\tinact ~ , ~ down:\btout{\shot{C}}\btout{\mathsf{ok}}\tinact ~ , ~quit:\btout{\mathsf{bye}}\tinact}_{}$$
that abstracts a server that offers different behaviors to clients: 
%  clients to select among distinct  behaviors: %namely, 
  to \emph{upload} a linear function, % (to be received by the server), 
  to \emph{download} a shared function, % (to be sent by the server),
   or to \emph{quit} the protocol. Subsequently, 
  the server sends a message ($\mathsf{ok}$ or $\mathsf{bye}$) before closing the session.




%The study of higher-order concurrency has received significant attention, 
%from untyped and typed perspectives (see, e.g.,~\cite{ThomsenB:plachoasgcfhop,SangiorgiD:expmpa,San96int,MostrousY15,DBLP:journals/iandc/LanesePSS11,DBLP:conf/icalp/LanesePSS10,DBLP:conf/esop/KoutavasH11,XuActa2012}),
%in particular via comparisons with the (first-order) $\pi$-calculus~\cite{MilnerR:calmp1}. 
%Higher-order calculi with {session primitives}, put forward in~\cite{tlca07,DBLP:journals/jfp/GayV10},
%allow for the specification of structured, reciprocal exchanges (protocols) 
%which can be verified via type-checking using {session types}~\cite{honda.vasconcelos.kubo:language-primitives}.
%Although models of session-typed 
%communication with features of higher-order concurrency exist
%their \emph{relative expressiveness}
%remains little understood. 

\jparagraph{The Problem}
%Roughly speaking, 
  \HOp %, a higher-order process language that 
extends Sangiorgi's higher-order $\pi$-calculus~\cite{SangiorgiD:expmpa} with session primitives.
To be precise, %More precisely, 
\HOp
includes
constructs for 
%session establishment
synchronisation along shared names, 
session communication (value passing, labelled choice) along linear names,
recursion, 
 (first-order) abstractions %(i.e., functions from name identifiers  to processes)
 and applications.
% (denoted $\lambda x.P$ and $(\lambda x.P)a$, resp.).
%While synchronization on shared names (useful to model session establishment) is 
%non deterministic, session communication is deterministic and occurs on linear names.
\HOp is therefore a rather rich language. This begs the question:
is there a \emph{sub-calculus} of \HOp with equal expressivity? %hich is as expressive as the whole calculus? 
This question is of foundational interest, 
for reasoning/validation techniques are more easily developed on small formalisms. 
It also has practical ramifications, 
as such a \emph{core calculus} could be taken as reference in 
the design of %(functional) 
programming languages with session types support.
%implementations of languages with session primitives.
Expressivity results may then help justifying useful connections 
between foundational and practical advances on languages with concurrency and communication.

%We have recently developed a behavioral theory  for \HOp~\cite{characteristic_bis}:
%we introduced
%\emph{characteristic bisimilarity}, a sound and complete 
%characterization of contextual equivalence. % that enables tractable analyses.


\jparagraph{Approach}
%Previous studies already suggest 
It is known
that first- and higher-order com\-mu\-ni\-cation %---the paradigms that uniformly coexist in \HOp---
independently constitute 
the main sources 
of expressivity in \HOp. %: \emph{name passing} and constructs for \emph{infinite behavior} (i.e., recursion and replication). 
On the one hand, the expressivity of name-passing calculi (untyped and typed) is well known; e.g., the $\pi$-calculus can express 
%the $\lambda$-calculus and 
process-passing calculi~\cite{SangiorgiD:expmpa}. 
%In the $\pi$-calculus, recursion and replication can be expressed in terms of each other. 
On the other hand, higher-order concurrency is itself quite expressive: 
even  calculi without name passing and recursion are known to be Turing equivalent~\cite{DBLP:journals/iandc/LanesePSS11}.
Also, in higher-order calculi,
recursion/replication operators are redundant, as they can be represented using process passing and duplication~\cite{ThomsenB:plachoasgcfhop}. 
%For these reasons, 
%Consequently, 
Based on these observations, 
in this paper we study the expressivity of \HOp in relation to two  sub-calculi
that distill the essence of first- and higher-order session-based concurrency:
\begin{enumerate}[-]
\item the session \sessp-calculus \jpc{(denoted~\sessp)}: \HOp without abstractions and applications;
\item the \HO-calculus: \HOp without recursion and name passing.
\end{enumerate}
%Interestingly, %\HO and \sessp distil the essence of higher- and first-order session-based concurrency:
We assess the expressivity 
 of \HOp, \HO, and \sessp as delineated by session types. 
We establish strong correspondences between 
these calculi via 
type-preserving, fully abstract encodings (up to 
behavioural equalities)---see \figref{fig:express}. 
While \sessp is, 
in essence, the calculus in~\cite{honda.vasconcelos.kubo:language-primitives}, 
%this paper shows 
our \emph{main discovery} is 
that \HO  is a new core calculus 
for %higher-order 
session concurrency.
%\figref{fig:express} summarises %our expressivity 
%our encodability results. 


%While encoding \HOp 
%into the $\pi$-calculus preserving session types 
%(extending  known  results for untyped processes~\cite{SangiorgiD:expmpa}) is 
%%\jpc{already}
%significant, 



\jparagraph{Contributions}
Our main contribution is 
an encoding of \HOp into \HO (\secref{subsec:HOpi_to_HO}).  
Since \HO lacks 
both name-passing and recursion, this encoding involves two key challenges:
\begin{enumerate}[a.]
\item In known (typed) 
encodings of name-passing into process-passing~\cite{SaWabook} %are limited: % in that 
%they come with restrictions on name usages;  
%they 
%work for %name-passing 
%calculi 
%with \emph{capability types} 
%in which 
only the output capability of names can be sent---a received name cannot be used in later inputs.
This is far too limiting in \HOp, where 
 session names %denoting arbitrary protocols 
 may be passed around (\emph{delegation})
and types describe interaction  \emph{structures}, rather than ``loose'' name capabilities. % at a given time.

\item %As mentioned above, recursion % and replication)
%can be encoded in untyped higher-order calculi using process duplication. Unfortunately, this kind of encodings 
Known encodings of recursion in untyped higher-order calculi
do not carry over to session typed calculi such as \HOp,
because linear abstractions cannot be copied/duplicated. Hence, the discipline of session types  limits 
the possibilities for representing infinite behaviors---even simple forms, such as input-guarded replication.
\end{enumerate}




%MOTIVATION FIRST ENCODING (). \emph{Still to highlight: recursive type required, no recursion, small example.

%--- 
\noi
%We illustrate our approach. % to these challenges.
Our encoding overcomes these two obstacles. 
Concerning (a), %we illustrate the essence of 
to encode name passing into \HO, 
%to encode name output, 
we ``pack''
the name to be sent into a suitable abstraction; 
upon reception, the receiver must ``unpack'' this object following a precise protocol on a fresh  session:
%More precisely, our encoding \jpc{of name passing} in \HO is given as:
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{rcll}
  $\map{\bout{a}{b} P}$	&$=$&	$\bout{a}{ \abs{z}{\,\binp{z}{x} (\appl{x}{b})} } \map{P}$ \\
  $\map{\binp{a}{x} Q}$	&$=$&	$\binp{a}{y} \newsp{s}{\appl{y}{s} \Par \bout{\dual{s}}{\abs{x}{\map{Q}}} \inact}$
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
%and as a homomorphism for the other operators.
Above, 
%where
$a,b$ are names and $s$ and $\dual{s}$ are 
linear session names (\emph{endpoints}).
%$\lambda x.P$ is a name abstraction of $P$; $\appl{x}{a}$ is a name application; 
Processes $\bout{a}{V} P$ and 
$\binp{a}{x} P$ denote output and input at~$a$;   
abstractions and applications are denoted
$\lambda x.P$ and $(\lambda x.P)a$; %, respectively;
$\newsp{s}P$ and $\inact$ represent hiding and inaction. %, respectively.
%Intuitively, the output of a name $b$ along name $a$ is encoded by
%the output of an abstraction containing $b$; the input of a name is encoded 
%by the input of an abstraction
Thus, following a communication on $a$, %our encoding features 
a (deterministic) reduction between  
$s$ and $\dual{s}$ guarantees that name $b$ is properly unpacked by means of abstraction passing
and appropriate applications.



Concerning (b), encoding a recursive process  is \NY{also} challenging for 
%the linearity of endpoints in $P$ must be preserved.
%The encoding of a recursive process $\recp{X}{P}$  is delicate, for it 
it must preserve the linearity of session endpoints. 
Given $\recp{X}{P}$, 
we encode the recursion body $P$ as a name abstraction
in which free names of $P$ are converted into name variables.
%The encoding keeps track of these free names.
The resulting higher-order value is embedded in an input-guarded 
``duplicator'' process~\cite{ThomsenB:plachoasgcfhop}.
Each occurrence of the recursion variable $X$ is then encoded 
in such a way that it
simulates recursion unfolding by 
invoking the duplicator in a by-need fashion.
That is, upon reception, the abstraction representing the 
recursion body $P$
is duplicated: 
one copy is used to reconstitute the original recursion body $P$ (through
the application of the free names of $P$); 
another copy is used to re-invoke the duplicator when needed. 
Interestingly, for this encoding strategy to work 
we require non-tail recursive session types; to this end, 
we apply recent advances on the theory of duality for session types~\cite{TGC14,DBLP:journals/corr/abs-1202-2086}.

%To this end, we
%first record a mapping from recursive variable $X$ to process variable $z_X$.
%Then, we encode the recursion body $P$ as a name abstraction
%in which free names of $P$ are converted into name variables, using \defref{d:auxmap}.
%(Notice that $P$ is first encoded into \HO and then transformed using mapping
%$\auxmapp{\cdot}{{}}{\sigma}$.)
%Subsequently, this higher-order value is embedded in an input-guarded 
%``duplicator'' process~\cite{ThomsenB:plachoasgcfhop}. Finally, we define the encoding of $X$ 
%in such a way that it
%simulates recursion unfolding by 
%invoking the duplicator in a by-need fashion.
%That is, upon reception, the \HO abstraction which encodes  the 
%recursion body $P$
%%containing $\auxmapp{P}{{}}{\sigma}$ 
%is duplicated: 
%one copy is used to reconstitute the original recursion body $P$ (through
%the application of $\fn{P}$); another copy is used to re-invoke
%the duplicator when needed. 
%
%We encode recursion with non-tail recursive session types; for this 
%we apply recent advances on the theory of session duality~\cite{TGC14,DBLP:journals/corr/abs-1202-2086}.

%it must preserve the linearity of session endpoints appeared in $P$.

%\cite{BernardiH14,TGC14,DBLP:journals/corr/abs-1202-2086}.}

Additional contributions include: (i)~the encodability of \HO into \sessp (\secref{subsec:HOp_to_sessp}); (ii)~a non encodability result showing that shared names strictly add expressive power to session calculi (\secref{ss:negative});
(iii)~extensions of our encodability results to richer settings (\secref{sec:extension}). 
In essence, (i) extends known  results for untyped processes~\cite{SangiorgiD:expmpa} to the session typed setting.
Although (ii) may be somewhat expected, to our knowledge we are the first to offer a proof of this separation result, 
exploiting session determinacy and typed equivalences.
Finally, concerning (iii), we develop extensions of our encodings to 
\begin{enumerate}[-]
\item The extension of \HOp with \emph{higher-order} abstractions (\HOpp); 
\item The extension of \HOp with polyadic name passing and abstraction (\pHOp); 
\item The super-calculus of \HOpp and \pHOp (\PHOpp), equivalent to the calculus in~\cite{tlca07}.

These
encodability results connect \HOp with existing higher-order process calculi~\cite{tlca07}, and  
further highlight the status of \HO as the core calculus for session concurrency.



\jparagraph{Precise Encodings}
Before closing this section, we find it instructive to discuss the notion of encoding 
upon which our 
encodability results stand.
Building upon established notions for (untyped) processes (e.g.,~\cite{DBLP:journals/iandc/Gorla10}), 
we define a notion of \emph{precise encoding} (\secref{s:expr}) that, as motivated earlier,  
requires the translation of both process and types, and 
admits only process mappings that preserve session types
\emph{and} are fully abstract. Thus, our encodings 
exhibit   strong behavioral correspondences, and 
 relate source and target processes with  
proper communication structures (as described by session types).
%Moreover, the notion of encoding includes full abstraction as encodability criteria.
We argue that these requirements make our developments more challenging.
In particular, requiring type preservation rules out encoding strategies only plausible for untyped processes.
To illustrate this point,
consider the  following encoding of %$\sessp$ 
name-passing 
into $\HO$:\footnote{This alternative  encoding was suggested by an anonymous reviewer of a previous version of this paper.} %defined as
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{rcll}
  $\umap{\bout{a}{b} P}$	&$=$&	$\binp{a}{x}( \appl{x}{b} \Par \umap{P})$ \\
  $\umap{\binp{a}{x} Q}$	&$=$&	$\bout{a}{\abs{x}{\umap{Q}}} \inact$
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
%and as a homomorphism for the other operators.
Intuitively, 
rather than sending a package with name $b$, 
this encoding sends the continuation of the input. This entails  a 
``role inversion'': outputs are translated into inputs, and inputs are translated into outputs. 
Although perfectly reasonable in an  {untyped setting}, the encoding $\umap{\cdot}$  
%is far from desirable in a session typed setting: 
is \emph{not type preserving}: 
since 
individual  prefixes represent actions in a structured communication sequence (abstracted by session types)
the role inversion defined by $\umap{\cdot}$ would alter the meaning of session protocols in the source language.

\jparagraph{Outline} This paper 
is structured as follows.
%\begin{enumerate}[$\bullet$]
%\item \secref{sec:overview} overviews key ideas of our tractable bisimulations.
%\item 
\secref{sec:calculus} presents the higher-order session calculus \HOp and its 
subcalculi \HO and \sessp.  Then, \secref{sec:types} gives the session type system
and states type soundness for \HOp and its variants.
%\item \secref{sec:behavioural} 
%develops \emph{higher-order} and \emph{characteristic} bisimilarities, our two
%tractable characterisations of contextual equivalence which 
%alleviate the issues of context bisimilarity~\cite{San96H}. These 
%relations are shown to coincide in \HOp (\thmref{the:coincidence}).
%\item 
\secref{s:expr} defines \emph{precise (typed) encodings} by extending encodability criteria 
studied for
untyped processes~(e.g.~\cite{DBLP:journals/iandc/Gorla10,DBLP:conf/icalp/LanesePSS10}).
%\item 
\secref{sec:positive} %and \S\,\ref{sec:negative}
gives encodings of \HOp into \HO and of \HOp into~\sessp.
These encodings 
are shown to be \emph{precise} (Thms.~\ref{f:enc:hopitoho} and~\ref{f:enc:hotopi}).
Mutual encodings between \sessp and \HO are derivable; 
all these calculi are thus equally expressive.
%Exploiting determinacy and typed equivalences,
We also prove the non-encodability of shared names
into linear names (\thmref{t:negative}).
%\item
\secref{sec:extension} studies extensions of \HOp. We show that 
both \HOpp (the extension with higher-order applications) 
and \pHOp (the extension with polyadicity) are encodable in \HOp
(Thms.~\ref{f:enc:hopiptohopi} and \ref{f:enc:phopiptohopi}).
This connects our work 
to the existing
higher-order session calculus in~\cite{tlca07} (here denoted  $\PHOpp$).

\secref{sec:relwork} concludes with related works.
