In \emph{higher-order process calculi} exchanged values may contain
processes: by integrating constructs from the $\lambda$-calculus and
the $\pi$-calculus these calculi enable the specification of
communications with mobile code.  This paper studies relative
expressiveness of \HOp, the higher-order $\pi$-calculus in which
communications are governed by \emph{session types}.  Our main
discovery is \HO, a subcalculus of \HOp which lacks name-passing and
recursion, can serve as a new core calculus for session-typed
higher-order concurrency.  We show that \HO can encode \HOp fully
abstractly up to typed contextual congruence more precisely and
efficiently than the first order session $\pi$-calculus (\sessp),
exploring a new typed bisimulation for \HO.  Overall, under session types,
$\HOp$, $\HO$, and $\sessp$ are equally expressive; but $\HOp$ and
$\HO$ are more tightly related than $\HOp$ and $\sessp$.
