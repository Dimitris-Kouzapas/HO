In \emph{higher-order process calculi} exchanged values may contain
processes: by integrating constructs from the $\lambda$-calculus and
the $\pi$-calculus these calculi enable the specification of
communications with mobile code.  This paper studies relative
expressiveness of \HOp, the higher-order $\pi$-calculus in which
communications are governed by \emph{session types}.  Our main
discovery is \HO, a subcalculus of \HOp which lacks name-passing and
recursion, can serve as a new core calculus for session-typed
higher-order concurrency.  We show that \HO can encode \HOp fully
abstractly up to typed contextual congruence more precisely and
efficiently than the first order session $\pi$-calculus (\sessp),
exploring a new typed bisimulation for \HO.  Overall, under session types,
$\HOp$, $\HO$, and $\sessp$ are equally expressive; but $\HOp$ and
$\HO$ are more tightly related than $\HOp$ and $\sessp$.

Our main discovery is that 
\HO, a subcalculus of \HOp which lacks name-passing and recursion, 
can serve as a new core calculus for session-typed higher-order
concurrency. 
%We propose a novel notion of 
%type-preseving \emph{precise encodings}: these are encodings that  
%satisfy usual syntactic and semantic encodability criteria, 
%but also \emph{preserve types}
%and satisfy \emph{full abstraction} up to typed behavioral equalities.
%We show that \HO can  encode 
%\HOp. 
By exploring a new bisimulation 
for \HO, 
we show that
 \HO can encode \HOp fully abstractly 
(up to 
%with higher-order abstractions/applications fully abstractly up to 
typed contextual congruence)
more precisely and efficiently than the first-order 
session $\pi$-calculus (\sessp).
Overall, under session types, 
%$\HOp$ with polyadic name passing, higher-order abstractions and 
%higher-order applications, 
$\HOp$, $\HO$, and $\sessp$ 
are equally expressive; but 
$\HOp$ and $\HO$ are more tightly related than 
$\HOp$ and $\sessp$.

%%In calculi for \emph{higher-order} concurrency, values exchanged as communication objects may include processes. Based on process passing, this paradigm is in contrast with the \emph{first-order} (or name passing) concurrency of the $\pi$-calculus. %based on name passing. 
%%%The higher-order paradigm is sometimes consideredBy combining mechanisms for functional and concurrent computation, these languages offer a unified account of different forms of interaction. 
%%Although previous works have related calculi for higher-order and first-order concurrency, little is known about the nature of this relationship when interactions are disciplined by \emph{types for structured communications}. Here we tackle this challenge from the perspective of \emph{session types}, focusing on \emph{typed behavioral equivalences} and issues of \emph{relative expressiveness}. First, we identify a core higher-order, session-typed calculus and develop for it  characterizations of typed contextual equivalences as labeled bisimilarities. 
%%Second, we formalize (non) encodability results between session calculi with either name-passing or process-passing mechanisms. 
%%Our results clarify the relationship between name- and process-passing in terms of high-level communication structures based on types.
