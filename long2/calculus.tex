\section{The Full Higher-Order Session $\pi$-Calculus (\HOp)}

We introduce the {\em Full Higher-Order Session $\pi$-calculus}
($\HOp$ in the following).
$\HOp$ features constructs for both name- and abstraction-passing;
it corresponds to a sub-calculus 
of the higher-order language studied by Mostrous and Yoshida in~\cite{tlca07}.
Although minimal, in \S\ref{s:expr}
the abstraction-passing capabilities of \HOp will prove 
expressive enough to capture key features of session communication, 
such as delegation and recursion.

\subsection{Syntax}

The syntax for $\HOp$ processes is given in Figure~\ref{fig:syntax}.
We use $a,b,c, \dots$ to range over shared names and
$s, \dual{s}, \dots$ to range over session names.
We use $m, n, t, \dots$ to range over shared or session names.
We define the dual operation over channels $n$ as $\dual{n}$ with
$\dual{\dual{s}} = s$ and $\dual{a} = a$.
Intuitively, names $s$ and $\dual{s}$ are dual \emph{endpoints}.
Variables are denoted with $x, y, z, \dots$, 
and recursive variables are denoted with $\varp{X}, \varp{Y} \dots$.
An abstraction $\abs{x}{P}$ is a process $P$ with bound parameter $x$.
Symbols $u, v, \dots$ range over names or variables. Furthermore
we use $V, W, \dots$ to denote transmittable values; either channels $u, v$ or
abstractions.

The name-passing construcsts of \HOp include the
$\pi$-calculus prefixes for sending and receiving values $V$.
Process $\bout{u}{V} P$ denotes the output of value $V$
over channel $u$, with continuation $P$;
process $\binp{u}{x} P$ denotes the input prefix on channel $u$ of a value
that it is going to be substituted on variable $x$ in continuation $P$. 
Recursion is expressed by the primitive recursor $\recp{X}{P}$,
which binds the recursive variable $\varp{X}$ in process $P$.
Process $\appl{x}{u}$ is the application
process which binds channel $u$ on the abstraction that
substitutes variable $X$.

Prefix $\bsel{u}{l} P$ selects label $l$ on channel $u$ and then behaves as $P$.
Given $i \in I$ process $\bbra{u}{l_i: P_i}_{i \in I}$ offers a choice on labels $l_i$ with
continuation $P_i$.
The calculus also includes standard constructs for 
inaction $\inact$,  parallel composition $P_1 \Par P_2$, and 
name restriction $\news{n} P$.
Session name restriction $\news{s} P$ simultaneously binds endpoints $s$ and $\dual{s}$ in $P$.

A well-formed process relies on assumptions for
guarded recursive processes.
A \emph{program} is a process without free 
recursion variables nor free name/process variables.

\subsection{Sub-calculi}

We identify two significant sub-calculi of $\HOp$ that will form 
the basis of our study:
%
\begin{enumerate}[-]
	\item	\sessp:
		The sub-calculus \sessp uses only name-passing constructs, i.e.~values
		are defined as $V \bnfis u$, and does not use the application process,
		$\appl{x}{u}$.

	\item	\HO:
		The sub-calculus \HO uses only abstraction passing, i.e.~values
		are defined as $V \bnfis \abs{x} P$ and does not use the primitive
		recursion constructs, $\varp{X}$ and $\recp{X}{P}$.
\end{enumerate}
%
Thus, while \sessp is essentially a standard session $\pi$-calculus as defined in the
literature~\cite{honda.vasconcelos.kubo:language-primitives,GH05},
\HO can be related to core higher-order process calculi whole expressiveness
in untyped~\cite{} and typed settings~\cite{}.
We use the superscript \minussh (e.g.~$\HOp^\minussh$)to denote a sub-calculus
without shared names, i.e~we define $u, v \bnfis s, \dual{s}$.  

\subsection{Operational Semantics}

The operational semantics for \HOp is given as a standard reduction relation, supported by
a \emph{structural congruence}, denoted $\scong$. This is 
the least congruence that satisfies the commutative monoid $(\Par, \inact)$:
%
\[
	\begin{array}{c}
		P \Par \inact \scong P
		\qquad
		P_1 \Par P_2 \scong P_2 \Par P_1
		\qquad
		P_1 \Par (P_2 \Par P_3) \scong (P_1 \Par P_2) \Par P_3
	\end{array}
\]
%
\noi and furthermore satisfies the rules:
%
\[
\begin{array}{c}
	n \notin \fn{P_1} \textrm{  implies  } P_1 \Par \news{n} P_2 \scong \news{n}(P_1 \Par P_2)
	\qquad
	\news{n} \inact \scong \inact
	\\
	\news{n} \news{m} P \scong \news{m} \news{n} P
	\qquad
	\recp{X}{P} \scong P\subst{\recp{X}{P}}{\rvar{X}}
	\qquad
	\appl{(\abs{x} P)}{u} \scong P \subst{x}{u}
\end{array}
\]
\noi The first rule is standard scope opening. The restriction
of a name in an inactive process has no effect. Furthermore
we can permute name restrictions. Recursion is defined
in structural congruence terms. Name application is also
defined in structural congruence terms where structural
congruence defines that application $\appl{(\abs{x} P)}{u}$ 
substitutes variable $x$ with name $u$ over abstraction $\abs{x} P$.

\input{figures/fig-reduction}

\noi Figure~\ref{fig:reduction} defines
%process variable substitution (upper part) and gives the 
the reduction semantics for \HOp.
%Both relations are defined in terms of polyadic semantics since
%monadic semantics are included in polyadicity.
%Substitution of application process $\appl{X}{\tilde{k}}$
%over abstraction $\abs{\tilde{x}}{Q}$ substitutes free variables
%$\tilde{x}$ in $Q$ with name $\tilde{k}$ and replaces
%$X$ with the resulting process.
%This simultaneous substitution $\subst{\tilde{k}}{\tilde{x}}$ is standard.
%There is no effect on variable substitution for the inactive process.
%In all other cases process variable substitution is defined
%homorphically on the structure of the process.
%There are three communication rules for $\HOp$. 
Rule~$\orule{Pass}$ defines the passing
of value $V$ on channel $n$ to its dual endpoint $\dual{n}$.
As a result of reduction the continuation of the 
latter process substitutes the receiving prefix variable $x$
with $V$.
%Rule~$\orule{APass}$ describes
%the passing of an abstraction $\abs{\tilde{x}}{P_1}$
%along channel $n$;
%the reception happens along a $\dual{n}$-prefixed process that
%leads to a process variable substitution as explained above.
Rule~$\orule{Sel}$ is the standard rule for labeled choice/selection:
given an index set $I$, 
a process selects label $l_j, j \in I$ on channel $n$ over a set of
labels $\set{l_i}_{i \in I}$ that are offered by a parallel process
on the dual session endpoint $\dual{n}$.
The resulting continuation is associated process $P_j$.
Remaining rules define congruence 
with respect to parallel composition (rule $\orule{Par}$)
and name restriction (rule $\orule{Ses}$).
Rule $\orule{Cong}$ defines closure under structural congruence.
