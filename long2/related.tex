\section{Related Work}

\paragraph{Expressiveness in Concurrency.}
There is a vast literature on expressiveness studies for process calculi;
we refer to~\cite{DBLP:journals/entcs/Parrow08} for a survey
(see also~\cite[\S\,2.3]{PerezPhD10}). 
In particular, the expressive power of the $\pi$-calculus has received much attention.
Studies cover, e.g., 
relationships between first-order and higher-order concurrency~(see, e.g.,~\cite{San923,San96int})
comparisons between 
synchronous and asynchronous communication~(see, e.g.,~\cite{Boudol92,Palamidessi03,BeauxisPV08}),
and
(non)encodability issues for different choice operators~(see, e.g.,~\cite{Nestmann00,DBLP:conf/esop/PetersNG13}).
To substantiate claims related to (relative) expressive power,
early works appealed to different definitions of encoding.
%For instance, Palamidessi~\cite{Palamidessi03} defines \emph{uniform encodings} as those encodings which are homomorphic wrt parallel composition, respect renamings, and respect a ``reasonable semantics.''
Later on, frameworks which formalize the notion of encoding 
in abstract terms
have been proposed, 
also stating desirable syntactic and semantic criteria underlying relative expressiveness; 
two proposals are~\cite{DBLP:journals/iandc/Gorla10,DBLP:journals/tcs/FuL10}. 
These frameworks are applicable to different calculi, and 
have shown useful to clarify known results and to derive new ones.
Our formulation of (precise) typed encoding (Definition~\ref{def:goodenc}) 
builds upon existing proposals (including~\cite{Palamidessi03,DBLP:journals/iandc/Gorla10,DBLP:conf/icalp/LanesePSS10})
in order to account for the session type systems
associated to the process languages under comparison.




\paragraph{Expressiveness of Higher-Order Process Calculi.}
Early expressiveness studies for higher-order calculi are~\cite{Tho90,San923}; 
more recent works include~\cite{BundgaardHG06,DBLP:conf/icalp/LanesePSS10,DBLP:journals/iandc/LanesePSS11,XuActa2012,DBLP:conf/wsfm/XuYL13}.
Due to the close relationship between higher-order process calculi and functional calculi, 
works devoted to encoding (variants of) the $\lambda$-calculus into (variants of) the $\pi$-calculus (see, e.g.,~\cite{San92,DBLP:journals/tcs/Fu99,DBLP:journals/iandc/YoshidaBH04,BHY,DBLP:conf/concur/SangiorgiX14}) are also worth mentioning.
The work~\cite{San923} gives an encoding of the higher-order $\pi$-calculus
into the first-order $\pi$-calculus which is fully abstract with respect to barbed congruence. 
A basic form of input/output types is used in~\cite{DBLP:journals/tcs/Sangiorgi01}, where the encoding in~\cite{San923} is casted in the asynchronous setting, where output and applications are merged in a single construct. Building upon~\cite{DBLP:journals/tcs/Sangiorgi01}, 
a simply typed encoding for synchronous processes is given in~\cite{SaWabook}; the reverse encoding (i.e.,  first-order communication into higher-order processes) is also studied there, although only for an asynchronous, localized $\pi$-calculus (only the output capability of names can be sent around).
The work~\cite{San96int} studies hierarchies for calculi with \emph{internal} first-order mobility and 
with higher-order mobility without name-passing (similarly as the subcalculus \HO). 
The hierarchies are based on expressivity: they describe different ``degrees of mobility'', and are 
formally defined according to the order of types needed in typing.
Via fully abstract encodings, it is shown that that name- and process-passing calculi with equal order of types have the same expressiveness.
With respect to these previous results, our approach based on session types 
has several important consequences and allows to derive new results.  Our study reinforces the intuitive view of ``encodings as protocols'', namely session protocols which enforce precise linear and shared disciplines for names, a distinction not investigated in~\cite{San923,DBLP:journals/tcs/Sangiorgi01}. 
In turn, the linear/shared distinction is central in proper definitions of trigger processes, which are essential to encodings and behavioral equivalences.
More interestingly, we showed that $\HO$, a  minimal higher-order session calculus (no name passing, only first-order application) suffices to encode $\sessp$ (the session calculus with name passing) but also 
$\HOp$  and 
its extension  with higher-order applications (denoted $\HOpp$). 
Thus, using session types all these calculi are shown to be equally expressive with fully abstract encodings.
To our knowledge, these are the first expressiveness results of this kind.

Other related works are~\cite{BundgaardHG06,XuActa2012,DBLP:journals/iandc/LanesePSS11}.
The paper~\cite{BundgaardHG06} proposes a fully abstract, continuation-passing style encoding of the 
$\pi$-calculus into Homer, a higher-order process calculus with explicit locations, local names, and nested locations.
The work~\cite{XuActa2012} studies the encodability of the higher-order $\pi$-calculus (extended with a relabeling operator) into the first-order $\pi$-calculus; encodings in the reverse direction are also proposed.
A minimal calculus of higher-order concurrency is studied in~\cite{DBLP:journals/iandc/LanesePSS11}: it lacks restriction,  name passing, output prefix (asynchronous communication), and constructs for infinite behavior. 
Nevertheless, this calculus (a sublanguage of \HO) is shown to be Turing complete. Moreover, 
strong bisimilarity is decidable and coincides with barbed congruence. 


Our work is closely related in spirit to the expressiveness studies in~\cite{DBLP:conf/icalp/LanesePSS10,DBLP:conf/wsfm/XuYL13}.
In~\cite{DBLP:conf/icalp/LanesePSS10}
the core calculus in~\cite{DBLP:journals/iandc/LanesePSS11} is extended with restriction, output prefix (thus enabling synchronous communication), 
and polyadic communication. It is shown that 
synchronous communication can encode asynchronous communication (as in the first-order setting),
and that process passing polyadicity induces a hierarchy in expressive power (unlike the first-order setting).
A further extension with process abstractions of order one
(functions from processes to processes)
 is shown to strictly add expressive power with respect to passing of processes only.
The paper~\cite{DBLP:conf/wsfm/XuYL13} complements the study in~\cite{DBLP:conf/icalp/LanesePSS10} by deepening on the expressive power of second-order abstractions (similar to \HO). 
In that setting, name and process abstractions are distinguished and contrasted, also considering polyadicity of abstraction parameters (as we have in \pHOp). It is shown that polyadicity of process abstraction induces an expressiveness hierarchy. Moreover, it is shown that name abstraction can encode process abstraction, and therefore it may be considered as a more basic mechanism. 
The works~\cite{DBLP:conf/icalp/LanesePSS10,DBLP:conf/wsfm/XuYL13} focus on untyped processes;
therefore, our work complements such previous results by clarifying the status of structured communications (as delineated by session types) in representability strategies of process passing (such as those based on triggers) both in encodings and (typed) behavioral equivalences; this allows us to clearly establish the use and role of linear/unrestricted names in such strategies.
