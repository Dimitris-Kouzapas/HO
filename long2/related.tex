\section{Related Work}

\paragraph{Expressiveness in Concurrency.}
There is a vast literature on expressiveness studies for process calculi;
the interested reader is referred to~\cite{DBLP:journals/entcs/Parrow08} for a survey
(see also~\cite[\S\,2.3]{PerezPhD10}). 
In particular, the expressive power of the $\pi$-calculus has received much attention.
Studies cover, e.g., 
relationships between first-order and higher-order concurrency~(see, e.g.,~\cite{San923,San96int})
comparisons between 
synchronous and asynchronous communication~(see, e.g.,~\cite{Boudol92,Palamidessi03,BeauxisPV08}),
and
(non)encodability results of different choice operators~(see, e.g.,~\cite{Nestmann00,DBLP:conf/esop/PetersNG13}).
To substantiate claims related to (relative) expressive power,
early works appealed to different definitions of encoding.
%For instance, Palamidessi~\cite{Palamidessi03} defines \emph{uniform encodings} as those encodings which are homomorphic wrt parallel composition, respect renamings, and respect a ``reasonable semantics.''
Later on, frameworks which formalize the notion of encoding 
in abstract terms
have been proposed, 
also stating desirable syntactic and semantic criteria underlying relative expressiveness; 
two proposals are~\cite{DBLP:journals/iandc/Gorla10,DBLP:journals/tcs/FuL10}. 
As such, these frameworks are applicable to different calculi.
They have shown useful to clarify known results and to derive new ones.
Our formulation of (precise) typed encoding (Definition~\ref{def:goodenc}) 
builds upon existing proposals (including~\cite{Palamidessi03,DBLP:journals/iandc/Gorla10,DBLP:conf/icalp/LanesePSS10})
in order to account for the session type systems
associated to the process languages under comparison.
