\section{Related Work}

\paragraph{Expressiveness in Concurrency.}
There is a vast literature on expressiveness studies for process calculi;
the interested reader is referred to~\cite{DBLP:journals/entcs/Parrow08,PerezPhD10} for surveys. 
In particular, the expressive power of the $\pi$-calculus has received much attention.
Notable studies cover, e.g., 
relationships between first-order and higher-order concurrency~(see, e.g.,~\cite{San923,San96int})
comparisons of asynchronous and synchronous communication~(see, e.g.,~\cite{Boudol92,Palamidessi03,BeauxisPV08}),
and
(non)encodability results of different forms of choice operators~(see, e.g.,~\cite{Nestmann00,DBLP:conf/esop/PetersNG13}).
Early works appealed to diverse definitions of encoding to substantiate claims related to (relative) expressive power;
this made it difficult to assess the significance of the various results.
As a remedy to this, abstract approaches to the notion of encoding 
(and its associated syntactic and semantic criteria)
have been proposed~(see, e.g.,~\cite{DBLP:journals/iandc/Gorla10,DBLP:journals/tcs/FuL10}). 
By unifying criteria underlying relative expressiveness, 
these abstract approaches have shown useful to simplify/generalize known results and derive new ones.
Unfortunately, 
to our knowledge, existing proposals 
of abstract frameworks for relative expressiveness do not account for type systems
associated to the process languages under comparison.
