\section{Related Work}

\paragraph{Expressiveness in Concurrency.}
There is a vast literature on expressiveness studies for process calculi;
the interested reader is referred to~\cite{DBLP:journals/entcs/Parrow08} for a survey
(see also~\cite[\S\,2.3]{PerezPhD10}). 
In particular, the expressive power of the $\pi$-calculus has received much attention.
Studies cover, e.g., 
relationships between first-order and higher-order concurrency~(see, e.g.,~\cite{San923,San96int})
comparisons between 
synchronous and asynchronous communication~(see, e.g.,~\cite{Boudol92,Palamidessi03,BeauxisPV08}),
and
(non)encodability results of different choice operators~(see, e.g.,~\cite{Nestmann00,DBLP:conf/esop/PetersNG13}).
To substantiate claims related to (relative) expressive power,
early works appealed to different definitions of encoding.
%For instance, Palamidessi~\cite{Palamidessi03} defines \emph{uniform encodings} as those encodings which are homomorphic wrt parallel composition, respect renamings, and respect a ``reasonable semantics.''
Later on, frameworks which formalize the notion of encoding 
in abstract terms
have been proposed, 
also stating desirable syntactic and semantic criteria underlying relative expressiveness; 
two proposals are~\cite{DBLP:journals/iandc/Gorla10,DBLP:journals/tcs/FuL10}. 
As such, these frameworks are applicable to different calculi.
They have shown useful to clarify known results and to derive new ones.
Our formulation of (precise) typed encoding (Definition~\ref{def:goodenc}) 
builds upon existing proposals (including~\cite{Palamidessi03,DBLP:journals/iandc/Gorla10,DBLP:conf/icalp/LanesePSS10})
in order to account for the session type systems
associated to the process languages under comparison.




\paragraph{Expressiveness of Higher-Order Process Calculi.}
Early studies of the higher-order process calculi are~\cite{San923,San96int}; 
more recent works include~\cite{DBLP:conf/icalp/LanesePSS10,DBLP:journals/iandc/LanesePSS11,XuActa2012,DBLP:conf/wsfm/XuYL13}.
The work~\cite{San923} defines the representability  of the higher-order $\pi$-calculus
into the first-order $\pi$-calculus, including also full abstraction with respect to barbed congruence. 
In~\cite{San923} a basic sorting mechanism is included; a representability result using input/output types is described in~\cite{SaWabook}. A hierarchy of process-passing calculi (without name passing) is studied in~\cite{San96int} and is shown to be fully abstract with respect to a hierarchy with internal mobility in the first-order setting; a typed system enforces different degrees of mobility for names in the first-order setting.
The work~\cite{XuActa2012} studies the encodability of the higher-order $\pi$-calculus (extended with a relabeling operator) into the first-order $\pi$-calculus; encodings in the reverse direction are also proposed.
A core calculus of higher-order concurrency is studied in~\cite{DBLP:journals/iandc/LanesePSS11}: this is a minimal asynchronous calculus, for it lacks restriction, recursion, and name passing. Still, the calculus is shown to be Turing complete. Moreover, 
strong bisimilarity is decidable and coincides with barbed congruence. 
In~\cite{DBLP:conf/icalp/LanesePSS10}
this calculus is extended with restriction, synchronous communication (i.e.,continuation after output), 
and polyadic communication. It is shown that 
synchronous communication can encode asynchronous communication (as in the first-order setting),
and that in the absence of name-passing process passing polyadicity induces a hierarchy in expressive power (unlike the first-order setting).
A further extension with process abstraction is shown to strictly add expressive power with respect to passing of processes only.
The paper~\cite{DBLP:conf/wsfm/XuYL13} complements the study in~\cite{DBLP:conf/icalp/LanesePSS10} by deepening on the expressive power of abstraction. Name and process abstractions are contrasted, also considering polyadicity. It is shown that polyadicity of process abstraction induces an expressiveness hierarchy. Moreover, it is shown that name abstractions can encode process abstractions, and therefore may be considered as more basic mechanisms. Thus, our work is closely related in spirit to the expressiveness studies in~\cite{DBLP:conf/icalp/LanesePSS10,DBLP:conf/wsfm/XuYL13}. We complement such previous expressiveness results by clarifying the status of structured communications as delineated by session types; this allows us to clarify the status and role of linearity in the encodbility of name and process abstractions.
