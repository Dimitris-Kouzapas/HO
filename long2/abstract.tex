This work proposes %efficient 
tractable
bisimulations 
for the higher-order $\pi$-calculus with session primitives (\HOp) and 
offers a complete 
study of the expressivity of its most significant subcalculi.
First we develop three typed bisimulations, which are shown to 
coincide with contextual equivalence.
These characterisations  
demonstrate that observing as inputs
only a specific finite set of higher-order values (which inhabit session types) suffices 
to reason about \HOp processes. 
Next, we identify \HO, 
a minimal, second-order  subcalculus of \HOp in which 
%does {\em not} equip with 
higher-order applications/abstractions, name-passing,
and recursion are absent.
We show that 
%two fully abstract encodings:
\HO can encode 
%the $n$-order \HOp
 \HOp extended with higher-order applications and abstractions
and 
that
a first-order session $\pi$-calculus can encode 
\HOp. %, fully abstractly.  
Both encodings are fully abstract.
We also 
prove that 
%then prove a  non-encodability result from 
the session $\pi$-calculus
with passing of shared names 
cannot be encoded 
into \HOp without shared names. 
We show that $\HOp$, $\HO$, and $\sessp$ are  equally expressive; 
the expressivity of \HO enables effective reasoning about 
typed equivalences for
higher-order processes.
