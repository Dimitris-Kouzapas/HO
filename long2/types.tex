\section{Session Types for $\HOp$}
\label{s:types}

In this section we define a session type system for
$\HOp$ and establish its main properties. We use as
a reference the type system for higher-order session processes 
developed by Mostrous and Yoshida~\cite{tlca07}.
Our system is simpler than that in~\cite{tlca07}, in order to distil the key
features of higher-order communication in a session-typed setting.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%  SYNTAX FOR TYPES
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\subsection{Syntax}

We define the syntax of session types for \HOp.

\begin{definition}[Syntax of Types]\rm
	\label{def:types}
	The syntax of types is defined on the types for sessions $S$,
	and the types for values $U$:
	%
	\[
	\begin{array}{lrcl}
		\textrm{(value)} & U & \bnfis &		C \bnfbar L 
		\\

		\textrm{(channels)} & C & \bnfis &	S \bnfbar \chtype{S} \bnfbar \chtype{L}
		\\

		\textrm{(lambda)} & L & \bnfis &	\shot{C} \bnfbar \lhot{C}
		\\

		\textrm{(session)} & S,T & \bnfis & 	\btout{U} S \bnfbar \btinp{U} S
							\bnfbar \btsel{l_i:S_i}_{i \in I} \bnfbar \btbra{l_i:S_i}_{i \in I}\\
					&&\bnfbar&	\trec{t}{S} \bnfbar \vart{t}  \bnfbar \tinact
	\end{array}
	\]
\end{definition}
%
\noi Values range over symbol $U$ which is defined by
first order values $C$ and higher order values $L$.
\noi First order values $C$ are used to type channels;
session types $S$ for session channels and shared types
$\chtype{S}$ or $\chtype{L}$ for shared channels that
carry session values and higher order values, respectively.
Higher-order types $L$ are used to type abstractions;
$\shot{C}$ and $\lhot{C}$ denote
shared and linear abstraction types, respectively.
%We write $U$ to denote types for values; first-order values and 
%higher-order values.

The syntax of session types $S$ follows the usual (binary) session
types with recursion~\cite{honda.vasconcelos.kubo:language-primitives,GH05}.
%to denote usual (binary) session types with recursion. 
Session type $\btout{U} S$ is assigned to a channel that first sends a 
value of type $U$ and then follows
the type described by $S$.
Dually, type $\btinp{U} S$ is assigned to a channel  
that first receives a value of type $U$ and then continues as $S$. 
Session types for labelled choice and selection, 
%are standard: they are 
written $\btbra{l_i:S_i}_{i \in I}$ and $\btsel{l_i:S_i}_{i \in I}$ respectively,
require a set of types $\set{S_i}_{i \in I}$ that correspond to a set of
labels $\set{i \in I}_{i \in I}$. 
Recursive session types are defined using the primitive recursor
and consider usual well-formedness conditions.
We let $\mathsf{T}$ to be the set of all well-formed types and
\ST to be the set of all well-formed session types.


Note that the syntax for value types is restricted
to dissallow types of the form:
i) $\chtype{\chtype{U}}$---shared names
cannot carry shared names;
and ii) $\shot{(\shot{U})}$---abstractions do not
bind a higher-order variables.
% $\chtype{U}$ and ,
%meaning that shared names cannot carry shared names and
%we that do not apply abstractions over abstractions.
The restricted values syntax is a main difference with respect to
the type structure  in~\cite{tlca07}, which 
supports the arrow types $U \sharedop T$ and 
$U \lollipop T$, where $T$ denotes an arbitrary term 
(i.e., a value or a process).

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%  DUALITY
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\subsection{Duality}

Duality is defined following the co-inductive
approach following~\cite{GH05,TGC14}.
We first require the notion of type equivalence.
%
\begin{definition}[Type Equivalence]\rm
\label{def:type_equiv}
	Define function $F(\Re): \mathsf{T} \longrightarrow \mathsf{T}$:
	%
	\[
		\begin{array}{rcl}
			F(\Re) 	&=&	\set{(\tinact, \tinact)} \\
				&\cup&	\set{(\chtype{S}, \chtype{T}) \bnfbar S\ \Re\ T} \cup \set{(\chtype{L_1}, \chtype{L_2}) \bnfbar L_1\ \Re\ L_2}\\
				&\cup&	\set{(\shot{C_1}, \shot{C_2}), (\lhot{C_1}, \lhot{C_2}) \bnfbar C_1\ \Re\ C_2}\\
				&\cup&	\set{(\btout{U_1} S, \btout{U_2} T)\,,\, (\btinp{U_1} S, \btinp{U_1} T) \bnfbar U_1\ \Re\ U_2, S\ \Re\ T}\\
				&\cup&	\set{(\btsel{l_i: S_i}_{i \in I} \,,\, \btsel{l_i: T_i}_{i \in I}) \bnfbar  S_i\ \Re\ T_i}\\
				&\cup&	\set{(\btbra{l_i: S_i}_{i \in I}\,,\, \btbra{l_i: T_i}_{i \in I}) \bnfbar S_i\ \Re\ T_i}\\
				&\cup&	\set{(S\,,\, T) \bnfbar S\subst{\trec{t}{S}}{\vart{t}}\ \Re\ T)}
				\cup	\set{(S\,,\, T) \bnfbar S\ \Re\ T\subst{\trec{t}{T}}{\vart{t}})}
		\end{array}
	\]	
	\noi Standard arguments ensure that $F$ is monotone, thus the greatest fixed point
	of $F$ exists. Let type equivalence be defined as $\iso = \nu X. F(X)$.
\end{definition}
%
In essence type equivalence is a co-inductive definition that
equates types up-to recursive unfolding.

The duality relation is defined in terms of type equivalence.
%
\begin{definition}[Duality]\rm
	Define function $F(\Re): \mathsf{ST} \longrightarrow \mathsf{ST}$:
	%
	\[
		\begin{array}{rcl}
			F(\Re) 	&=&	\set{(\tinact, \tinact)}\\
				&\cup&	\set{(\btout{U_1} S, \btinp{U_2} T)\,,\, (\btinp{U} S, \btout{U} T) \bnfbar U_1 \iso U_2, S\ \Re\ T}\\
				&\cup&	\set{(\btsel{l_i: S_i}_{i \in I} \,,\, \btbra{l_i: T_i}_{i \in I}) \bnfbar  S_i\ \Re\ T_i}\\
				&\cup&	\set{(\btbra{l_i: S_i}_{i \in I}\,,\, \btsel{l_i: T_i}_{i \in I}) \bnfbar S_i\ \Re\ T_i}\\
				&\cup&	\set{(S\,,\, T) \bnfbar S\subst{\trec{t}{S}}{\vart{t}}\ \Re\ T)}\\
				&\cup&	\set{(S\,,\, T) \bnfbar S\ \Re\ T\subst{\trec{t}{T}}{\vart{t}})}
		\end{array}
	\]	
	\noi Standard arguments ensure that $F$ is monotone, thus the greatest fixed point
	of $F$ exists. Let duality be defined as $\dualof = \nu X. F(X)$.
\end{definition}
%
The co-inductive definition of duality relates session types
up-to recursive unfolding. Dual session types are prefixed
on dual constructors and carry equivalent types.

\subsection{Environments and Judgements}
%Following our decision of focusing on functions
%$\shot{U}$ and $\lhot{U}$, our environments are
%simpler than those in~\cite{tlca07}:
%
We follow~\cite{tlca07},
to defined the typing environment.
%
\begin{definition}[Typing environent]\rm
	We define the {\em shared type environment} $\Gamma$,
	and the linear environments
	{\em linear type environment} $\Lambda$ and
	the {\em session type environment} $\Delta$ as:
	\[
	\begin{array}{llcl}
		\text{Linear}	& \Lambda & \bnfis &	\emptyset \bnfbar \Lambda \cat \varp{X}: \lhot{C}\\
		\text{Session}	& \Delta  & \bnfis &	\emptyset \bnfbar \Delta \cat u:S \\
		\text{Shared}	& \Gamma  & \bnfis &	\emptyset \bnfbar \Gamma \cat \varp{X}: \shot{C} \bnfbar \Gamma \cat u: \chtype{S} \bnfbar
							\Gamma \cat u: \chtype{L} \bnfbar \Gamma \cat \rvar{X}: \Delta
	\end{array}
	\]
	We imply
	\begin{enumerate}[i.]
		\item	Domains of $\Gamma, \Lambda, \Delta$ are pairwise distinct.
		\item	Weakening, contraction and exchange apply to shared environment $\Gamma$.
		\item	Exchange applies to linear environments $\Lambda$ and $\Delta$. 
	\end{enumerate}
\end{definition}
%
\noi We define typing judgements for values $V$
and processes $P$:
%
\[	\begin{array}{c}
		\Gamma; \Lambda; \Delta \proves V \hastype U \qquad \qquad \qquad \Gamma; \Lambda; \Delta \proves P \hastype \Proc
	\end{array}
\]
%
%\noi
%As expected, weakening, contraction, and exchange principles apply to $\Gamma$;
%environments $\Lambda$ and $\Delta$ behave linearly, and are only subject to exchange.
%We require that the domains of $\Gamma, \Lambda$ and $\Delta$ are pairwise distinct.
The first judgement asserts that under environment $\Gamma; \Lambda; \Delta$
values $V$ have type $U$,
whereas the second judgement assertss that under environment $\Gamma; \Lambda; \Delta$
process $P$ has the typed process type $\Proc$.

\subsection{Typing Rules}

\input{figures/fig-types}

The type relation is defined in Figure~\ref{fig:typerulesmy}.
%Types for session names/variables $u$ and
%directly derived from the linear part of the typing
%environment, i.e.~type maps $\Delta$ and $\Lambda$.
Rules $\trule{Session}$ and $\trule{LVar}$ require,
respectively, the minimal:
i) session environment $\Delta$ to type session 
$u$ with type $S$; and,
ii) linear environment $\Lambda$ to type 
higher-order variable $x$ with type $\shot{\tilde{C}}$.
Rule $\trule{Shared}$
assigns the value type $U$
to shared names or shared variables $u$ 
if the map $u:U$ exists in environment
$\Gamma$. Rule $\trule{Shared}$ also requires 
that the linear environment is
be minimal, i.e.~empty.
The type $\shot{C}$ for shared higher-order values $V$
is derived using rule $\trule{Prom}$, where we require
a value with linear type to be typed without a linear
environment present in order to be used as a shared type.
Rule $\trule{EProm}$ allows to freely use a linear
type variable as shared type variable. 
%A value consisting of a tuple of names/variables is typed using the $\trule{Pol}$ rule,
%which requires theto type and combine each value in the tuple.
Abstraction values are typed with rule $\trule{Abs}$.
The key type for an abstraction is the type for
the bound variables of the abstraction, i.e.~for
bound variable with type $C$ the abstraction
has type $\lhot{C}$.
The dual of abstraction typing is application typing
governed by rule $\trule{App}$, where we expect
the type $C$ of an application name $u$ 
to match the type $\lhot{C}$ or $\shot{C}$
of the application variable $x$.

A process prefixed with a session send operator $\bout{u}{V} P$
is typed using rule $\trule{Send}$.
The type $U$ of a send value $V$ should appear as a prefix
on the session type $\btout{U} S$ of $s$.
Rule $\trule{Rcv}$
defines the typing for the 
reception of values $\binp{u}{V} P$.
%and abstractions $\binp{k}{X} P$, respectively.
The type $U$ of a receive value should 
appear as a prefix on the session type $\btinp{U} S$ of $u$.
We use a similar approach with session prefixes
to type interaction between shared channels as defined 
in rules $\trule{Req}$ and $\trule{Acc}$,
where the type of the sent/received object 
($S$ and $L$, respectively) should
match the type of the sent/received subject
($\chtype{S}$ and $\chtype{L}$, respectively).
%In the case of rule $\trule{Req}$ we require
%a duality condition for the communication of session names.
Select and branch prefixes are typed using the rules
$\trule{Sel}$ and $\trule{Bra}$ respectively. Both
rules prefix the session type with the selection
type $\btsel{l_i: S_i}_{i \in I}$ and
$\btbra{l_i:S_i}_{i \in I}$.

The creation of a
shared name $a$ requires to add
its type in environment $\Gamma$ as defined in 
rule \trule{Res}. 
Creation of a session name $s$
creates two endpoints with dual types and adds them to
the session environment 
$\Delta$ as defined in rule \trule{ResS}. 
Rule \trule{Par} concatanates the linear environment of
the parallel components of a parallel operator
to create a type for the entire process.
The disjointness of environments $\Lambda$ and $\Delta$
is implied. Rule \trule{End} allows a form of weakening 
for the session environment $\Delta$, provided that
the name added in $\Delta$ has the inactive
type $\tinact$. The inactive process $\inact$ has no
linear environment. The recursive variable is typed
directly from the shared environment $\Gamma$ as
in rule \trule{RVar}.
The recursive operator requires that the body of
a recursive process matches the type of the recursive
variable as in rule \trule{Rec}.

\subsection{Type Soundness}

%We state results for type safety:
Type safety result are instances of more general statements already proved by
Mostrous and Yoshida~\ref{tlca07} in the asynchronous case.

\begin{lemma}[Substitution Lemma - Lemma C.10 in M\&Y]\rm
	\label{lem:subst}
	\begin{enumerate}[1.]
		\item	$\Gamma; \Lambda; \Delta \cat x:S  \proves P \hastype \Proc$ and
			$u \not\in \dom{\Gamma, \Lambda, \Delta}$
			implies
			$\Gamma; \Lambda; \Delta \cat u:S  \proves P\subst{u}{x} \hastype \Proc$.

		\item	$\Gamma \cat x:\chtype{U}; \Lambda; \Delta \proves P \hastype \Proc$ and
			$a \notin \dom{\Gamma, \Lambda, \Delta}$
			implies
			$\Gamma \cat a:\chtype{U}; \Lambda; \Delta \proves P\subst{a}{x} \hastype \Proc$.

		\item	If $\Gamma; \Lambda_1 \cat x:\lhot{C}; \Delta_1  \proves P \hastype \Proc$ 
			and $\Gamma; \Lambda_2; \Delta_2  \proves V \hastype \lhot{C}$ with 
			$\Lambda_1 \cat \Lambda_2$ and $\Delta_1 \cat \Delta_2$ defined,
			then $\Gamma; \Lambda_1 \cat \Lambda_2; \Delta_1 \cat \Delta_2  \proves P\subst{V}{x} \hastype \Proc$.

		\item	$\Gamma \cat x:\shot{C}; \Lambda; \Delta  \proves P \hastype \Proc$ and
			$\Gamma; \emptyset ; \emptyset \proves V \hastype \shot{C}$
			implies
			$\Gamma; \Lambda; \Delta \proves P\subst{V}{x} \hastype \Proc$.
		\end{enumerate}
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
	By induction on the typing for $P$, with a case analysis on the last used rule. 
	\qed
\end{proof}

\begin{definition}[Balanced Session Environment]\label{d:wtenv}\rm
%	Let $\Delta$ be a session environment.
	We say that session environment $\Delta$ is {\em balanced} if
	$s: S_1, \dual{s}: S_2 \in \Delta$ implies $S_1 \dualof S_2$.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Session Environment Reduction]\rm
	\label{def:ses_red}
	The reduction relation $\red$ on session environments is defined as:
%
	\begin{enumerate}[$-$]
		\item	$\Delta \cat s: \btout{U} S_1 \cat \dual{s}: \btinp{U} S_2 \red \Delta \cat s: S_1 \cat \dual{s}: S_2$
		\item	$\Delta \cat s: \btsel{l_i: S_i}_{i \in I} \cat \dual{s}: \btbra{l_i: S_i'}_{i \in I} \red \Delta \cat s: S_k \cat \dual{s}: S_k', \quad k \in I$.
	\end{enumerate}
\end{definition}
%
We now state the main soundness result as an instance
of type soundness from the Mostrous and Yoshida system.
It is worth noticing that M\&Y have a slightly richer
definition of structural congruence.
Also, their statement for subject reduction relies on an
ordering on typing associated to queues and other 
runtime elements (such extended typing is denoted as $\Delta$ by M\&Y).
Since we are dealing with synchronous semantics we can omit such an ordering.

\begin{theorem}[Type Soundness - Theorem 7.3 in M\&Y]\label{t:sr}\rm
%
	\begin{enumerate}[1.]
		\item	(Subject Congruence)
			$\Gamma; \es; \Delta \proves P \hastype \Proc$
			implies
			$P \scong P'$ implies $\Gamma; \es; \Delta \proves P' \hastype \Proc$.

		\item	(Subject Reduction)
			$\Gamma; \es; \Delta \proves P \hastype \Proc$
			with
			balanced $\Delta$
			implies
			$P \red P'$ implies $\Gamma; \es; \Delta'  \proves P' \hastype \Proc$
			and either (i)~$\Delta = \Delta'$ or (ii)~$\Delta \red \Delta'$
			(with $\Delta'$ balanced).
	\end{enumerate}
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
	See Appendix \ref{app:ts}.
	\qed
\end{proof}
