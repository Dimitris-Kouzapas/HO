\section{Session Types for $\HOp$}
\label{s:types}

In this section we define a session type system for
$\HOp$ and establish its main properties. We use as
a reference the type system for higher-order session processes 
developed by Mostrous and Yoshida~\cite{tlca07}.
Our system is simpler than that in~\cite{tlca07}, in order to distill the key
features of higher-order communication in a session-typed setting.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%  SYNTAX FOR TYPES
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\subsection{Syntax}
%We write $\Proc$ to denote the type of processes.
The type syntax for values and sessions
(denoted $U$ and $S$, respectively) is as follows:
%
\[
\begin{array}{lrcl}
	\textrm{(channels)} & C & \bnfis &	S \bnfbar \chtype{S} \bnfbar \chtype{L}
	\\

	\textrm{(lambda)} & L & \bnfis &	\shot{C} \bnfbar \lhot{C}
	\\

	\textrm{(value)} & U & \bnfis &	C \bnfbar L 
	\\

	\textrm{(session)} & S,T & \bnfis & 	\btout{U} S \bnfbar \btinp{U} S
						\bnfbar \btsel{l_i:S_i}_{i \in I} \bnfbar \btbra{l_i:S_i}_{i \in I}\\
				&&\bnfbar&	\trec{t}{S} \bnfbar \vart{t}  \bnfbar \tinact
\end{array}
\]
%
\noi We write $C$ to denote first-order channel types; session types $S$
for session channels and shared types $\chtype{S}$ or $\chtype{L}$ 
for shared channels.
We write $L$ to denote types for abstractions (higher-order values): % In particular, 
$\shot{C}$ and $\lhot{C}$ denote
shared and linear abstraction types, respectively.
We write $U$ to denote types for values; first-order values and 
higher-order values.
Note that our type syntax disallows types of
the form $\chtype{\chtype{U}}$, $\chtype{\tilde{U}}$
and $\shot{(\shot{U})}$,
meaning that shared names cannot carry shared names and
we that do not apply abstractions over abstractions.
This is a main difference with respect to the type structure 
in~\cite{tlca07}, which  supports arrow types 
$U \sharedop T$ and 
$U \lollipop T$, where $T$ denotes an arbitrary term 
(i.e., a value or a process).

We write $S$ to denote usual (binary) session types with recursion. 
Session type $\btout{U} S$ is assigned to a channel that first sends a 
value of type $U$ and then follows
the protocol described by $S$.
Dually, type $\btinp{U} S$ is assigned to a channel  
that first receives a value of type $U$ and then continues as $S$. 
Session types for labeled choice and selection are standard: they are 
written $\btbra{l_i:S_i}_{i \in I}$ and $\btsel{l_i:S_i}_{i \in I}$ , respectively. 
Recursive types are also as customary, considering usual 
well-formedness conditions. We let \ST to be the set of
all well formed session types.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%  DUALITY
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\subsection{Duality}
We first define type equivalence.
%
\begin{definition}[Type Equivalence]\rm
\label{def:type_equiv}
	Let $\mathsf{T}$ be the set of all well formed types.
	Define function $F(\Re): \mathsf{T} \longrightarrow \mathsf{T}$:
	%
	\[
		\begin{array}{rcl}
			F(\Re) 	&=&	\set{(\tinact, \tinact)}
				\cup	\set{(\chtype{S}, \chtype{T}) \bnfbar S\ \Re\ T} \cup \set{(\chtype{L_1}, \chtype{L_2}) \bnfbar L_1\ \Re\ L_2}\\
				&\cup&	\set{(\shot{C_1}, \shot{C_2}), (\lhot{C_1}, \lhot{C_2}) \bnfbar C_1\ \Re\ C_2}\\
				&\cup&	\set{(\btout{U_1} S, \btout{U_2} T)\,,\, (\btinp{U_1} S, \btinp{U_1} T) \bnfbar U_1\ \Re\ U_2, S\ \Re\ T}\\
				&\cup&	\set{(\btsel{l_i: S_i}_{i \in I} \,,\, \btsel{l_i: T_i}_{i \in I}) \bnfbar  S_i\ \Re\ T_i}\\
				&\cup&	\set{(\btbra{l_i: S_i}_{i \in I}\,,\, \btbra{l_i: T_i}_{i \in I}) \bnfbar S_i\ \Re\ T_i}\\
				&\cup&	\set{(S\,,\, T) \bnfbar S\subst{\trec{t}{S}}{\vart{t}}\ \Re\ T)}
				\cup	\set{(S\,,\, T) \bnfbar S\ \Re\ T\subst{\trec{t}{T}}{\vart{t}})}
		\end{array}
	\]	
	\noi Standard arguments ensure that $F$ is monotone, thus the greatest fixed point
	of $F$ exists. Let type equicalence be defined as $\iso = \nu X. F(X)$.
\end{definition}
%
We follow the approach in~\cite{onSessionDualityBDGK} to define the 
key notion of duality for session types.
%
\begin{definition}[Duality]\rm
	Define function $F(\Re): \mathsf{ST} \longrightarrow \mathsf{ST}$:
	%
	\[
		\begin{array}{rcl}
			F(\Re) 	&=&	\set{(\tinact, \tinact)}\\
				&\cup&	\set{(\btout{U_1} S, \btinp{U_2} T)\,,\, (\btinp{U} S, \btout{U} T) \bnfbar U_1 \iso U_2, S\ \Re\ T}\\
				&\cup&	\set{(\btsel{l_i: S_i}_{i \in I} \,,\, \btbra{l_i: T_i}_{i \in I}) \bnfbar  S_i\ \Re\ T_i}\\
				&\cup&	\set{(\btbra{l_i: S_i}_{i \in I}\,,\, \btsel{l_i: T_i}_{i \in I}) \bnfbar S_i\ \Re\ T_i}\\
				&\cup&	\set{(S\,,\, T) \bnfbar S\subst{\trec{t}{S}}{\vart{t}}\ \Re\ T)}\\
				&\cup&	\set{(S\,,\, T) \bnfbar S\ \Re\ T\subst{\trec{t}{T}}{\vart{t}})}
		\end{array}
	\]	
	\noi Standard arguments ensure that $F$ is monotone, thus the greatest fixed point
	of $F$ exists. Let duality be defined as $\dualof = \nu X. F(X)$.
\end{definition}

\subsection{Environments and Judgments}
%Following our decision of focusing on functions
%$\shot{U}$ and $\lhot{U}$, our environments are
%simpler than those in~\cite{tlca07}:
%
Following~\cite{tlca07}, 
our typing discipline relies on the following typing environments: %We consider the
\[
\begin{array}{llcl}
	\text{Linear}	& \Lambda & \bnfis &	\emptyset \bnfbar \Lambda \cat \varp{X}: \lhot{C}\\
	\text{Session}	& \Delta  & \bnfis &	\emptyset \bnfbar \Delta \cat k:S \\
	\text{Shared}	& \Gamma  & \bnfis &	\emptyset \bnfbar \Gamma \cat \varp{X}: \shot{C} \bnfbar \Gamma \cat k: \chtype{S} \bnfbar
						\Gamma \cat k: \chtype{L} \bnfbar \Gamma \cat \rvar{X}: \Delta
\end{array}
\]
%
\noi We define typing judgements for values $V$
and processes $P$:
%
\[	\begin{array}{c}
		\Gamma; \Lambda; \Delta \proves V \hastype U \qquad \qquad \qquad \Gamma; \Lambda; \Delta \proves P \hastype \Proc
	\end{array}
\]
%
\noi As expected, weakening, contraction, and exchange principles apply to $\Gamma$;
environments $\Lambda$ and $\Delta$ behave linearly, and are only subject to exchange.
We require that the domains of $\Gamma, \Lambda$ and $\Delta$ are pairwise distinct.
The first judgement states that under environment $\Gamma; \Lambda; \Delta$
values $V$ have type $U$,
whereas the second judgement states that under environment $\Gamma; \Lambda; \Delta$
process $P$ has the process type $\Proc$.

\subsection{Typing Rules}

\input{figures/fig-types}

The typing system is defined in Figure~\ref{fig:typerulesmy}.
%Types for session names/variables $u$ and
%directly derived from the linear part of the typing
%environment, i.e.~type maps $\Delta$ and $\Lambda$.
Rules $\trule{Session}$ and $\trule{LVar}$ require
the minimal linear environment: i) a minimal session enviroment
$\Delta$ to type sessions $u$ with type $S$; and ii)
a minimal linear environment $\Lambda$ to type 
higher order variables $x$ with type $\shot{\tilde{C}}$.
Rule $\trule{Shared}$
types shared names or shared variables $u$ with
type $U$ if the map $u:U$ exists in environment
$\Gamma$. Again the linear environment should
be minimal, i.e.,empty.
The type $\shot{C}$ for shared higher order values $V$
is derived using rule $\trule{Prom}$, where we require
a value with linear type to be typed without a linear
environment in order to be used as a shared type.
Rule $\trule{EProm}$ allows to freely use a linear
type variable as shared type variable. 
%A value consisting of a tuple of names/variables is typed using the $\trule{Pol}$ rule,
%which requires theto type and combine each value in the tuple.
Abstraction values are typed with rule $\trule{Abs}$.
The key type for an abstraction is the type for
the bound variables of the abstraction, i.e.~for
bound variable type $C$ the abstraction
has type $\lhot{C}$.
The dual of abstraction typing is application typing
governed by rule $\trule{App}$, where we expect
the type $C$ of an application name $u$ 
to match the type $\lhot{C}$ or $\shot{C}$
of the application variable $x$.

A process prefixed with a session send operator $\bout{k}{V} P$
is typed using rule $\trule{Send}$.
The type $U$ of a send value $V$ should appear as a prefix
on the session type $\btout{U} S$ of $s$.
Rule $\trule{Rcv}$
defined the typing for the 
reception of values $\binp{u}{V} P$.
%and abstractions $\binp{k}{X} P$, respectively.
The type $U$ of a receive value should 
appear as a prefix on the session type $\btinp{U} S$ of $u$.
We use a similar approach with session prefixes
to type interaction between shared channels as defined 
in rules $\trule{Req}$ and $\trule{Acc}$,
where the type of the sent/received object 
($S$ and $L$, respectively) should
match the type of the sent/received subject
($\chtype{S}$ and $\chtype{L}$, respectively).
%In the case of rule $\trule{Req}$ we require
%a duality condition for the communication of session names.
Select and branch prefixes are typed using the rules
$\trule{Sel}$ and $\trule{Bra}$ respectively. Both
rules prefix the session type with the selection
type $\btsel{l_i: S_i}_{i \in I}$ and
$\btbra{l_i:S_i}_{i \in I}$.

Creating and restricting a
shared name $a$ requires to remove
its type from environment $\Gamma$ as defined in 
rule \trule{Res}. 
Creation of a session name $s$
creates two endpoints with dual types and restricts
them by removing them from the session environment
$\Delta$ as defined in rule \trule{ResS}. 
%This is the only duality check present in our system.
Rule \trule{Par} combines the linear environment of
the parallel components of a parallel process
to create a type for the entire parallel process.
The disjointness of environmnts $\Lambda$ and $\Delta$
is implied. Rule \trule{End} allows a form of weakening 
for the session environment $\Delta$, provided that
the names added in $\Delta$ have the inactive
type $\tinact$. The inactive process $\inact$ has no
linear environment. The recursive variable is typed
directly from the shared environment $\Gamma$ as
in rule \trule{RVar}.
The recursive operator requires that the body of
a recursive process matches the type of the recursive
variable as in rule \trule{Rec}.

%\begin{definition}[$\proves_s$]\rm
%	Assume type system that does not use
%	type rule $\trule{Shared}$, denoted
%	$\proves_s$.
%\end{definition}
%
%\begin{proposition}
%	$\Gamma; \es; \Delta \proves_s P \hastype \Proc$
%	implies
%	$\not\exists a, a \in (\fn{P} \cup \bn{P})$.
%\end{proposition}


\subsection{Type Soundness}
We state results for type safety:
we report instances of more general statements already proved by
Mostrous and Yoshida in the asynchronous case.

\begin{lemma}[Substitution Lemma - Lemma C.10 in M\&Y]\rm
	\label{lem:subst}
	\begin{enumerate}[1.]
		\item	$\Gamma; \Lambda; \Delta \cat x:S  \proves P \hastype \Proc$ and
			$u \not\in \dom{\Gamma, \Lambda, \Delta}$
			implies
			$\Gamma; \Lambda; \Delta \cat u:S  \proves P\subst{u}{x} \hastype \Proc$.

		\item	$\Gamma \cat x:\chtype{U}; \Lambda; \Delta \proves P \hastype \Proc$ and
			$a \notin \dom{\Gamma, \Lambda, \Delta}$
			implies
			$\Gamma \cat a:\chtype{U}; \Lambda; \Delta \proves P\subst{a}{x} \hastype \Proc$.

		\item	If $\Gamma; \Lambda_1 \cat x:\lhot{C}; \Delta_1  \proves P \hastype \Proc$ 
			and $\Gamma; \Lambda_2; \Delta_2  \proves V \hastype \lhot{C}$ with 
			$\Lambda_1 \cat \Lambda_2$ and $\Delta_1 \cat \Delta_2$ defined,
			then $\Gamma; \Lambda_1 \cat \Lambda_2; \Delta_1 \cat \Delta_2  \proves P\subst{V}{x} \hastype \Proc$.

		\item	$\Gamma \cat x:\shot{C}; \Lambda; \Delta  \proves P \hastype \Proc$ and
			$\Gamma; \emptyset ; \emptyset \proves V \hastype \shot{C}$
			implies
			$\Gamma; \Lambda; \Delta \proves P\subst{V}{x} \hastype \Proc$.
		\end{enumerate}
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
	By induction on the typing for $P$, with a case analysis on the last used rule. 
	\qed
\end{proof}

\begin{definition}[Well-typed Session Environment]\label{d:wtenv}\rm
%	Let $\Delta$ be a session environment.
	We say that session environment $\Delta$ is {\em well-typed} if
	$s: S_1, \dual{s}: S_2 \in \Delta$ implies $S_1 \dualof S_2$.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Session Environment Reduction]\rm
\label{def:ses_red}
	The reduction relation $\red$ on session environments is defined as:
%
	\begin{enumerate}[$-$]
		\item	$\Delta \cat s: \btout{U} S_1 \cat \dual{s}: \btinp{U} S_2 \red \Delta \cat s: S_1 \cat \dual{s}: S_2$
		\item	$\Delta \cat s: \btsel{l_i: S_i}_{i \in I} \cat \dual{s}: \btbra{l_i: S_i'}_{i \in I} \red \Delta \cat s: S_k \cat \dual{s}: S_k', \quad k \in I$.
	\end{enumerate}
\end{definition}

We now state the instance of type soundness that we can derived from the Mostrous and Yoshida system.
It is worth noticing that M\&Y have a slightly richer definition of structural congruence.
Also, their statement for subject reduction relies on an ordering on typings associated to queues and other 
runtime elements (such extended typings are denoted $\Delta$ by M\&Y).
Since we are synchronous we can omit such an ordering.

\begin{theorem}[Type Soundness - Theorem 7.3 in M\&Y]\label{t:sr}\rm
%
	\begin{enumerate}[1.]
		\item	(Subject Congruence)
			$\Gamma; \es; \Delta \proves P \hastype \Proc$
			implies
			$P \scong P'$ implies $\Gamma; \es; \Delta \proves P' \hastype \Proc$.

		\item	(Subject Reduction)
			$\Gamma; \es; \Delta \proves P \hastype \Proc$
			with
			well-typed $\Delta$
			implies
			$P \red P'$ implies $\Gamma; \es; \Delta'  \proves P' \hastype \Proc$
			and either (i)~$\Delta = \Delta'$ or (ii)~$\Delta \red \Delta'$
			(with $\Delta'$ well-formed).
	\end{enumerate}
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
	See Appendix \ref{app:ts}.
	\qed
\end{proof}
