%\myparagraph{Session Typed Processes.}
%The works~\cite{DemangeonH11,Dardha:2012:STR:2370776.2370794} 
%study encodings of binary session calculi into a linearly typed $\pi$-calculus. 
%While~\cite{DemangeonH11}~gives a precise encoding of \sessp into a linear calculus 
%(an extension of \cite{BHY}),  
%the work~\cite{Dardha:2012:STR:2370776.2370794} 
%gives operational correspondence (without full abstraction, cf.~\defref{def:sep}-4)
%for the first- and higher-order 
%$\pi$-calculi into \cite{LinearPi}. 
%They investigate embeddability of two different typing systems;
%by the result of \cite{DemangeonH11}, 
%\HOpp is encodable  into the linearly typed $\pi$-calculi.     
%
%The syntax of $\HOp$ is a subset of that in~\cite{tlca07,MostrousY15}.
%The work~\cite{tlca07} develops a full higher-order session calculus
%with process abstractions and applications; it admits the type 
%$U=U_1 \rightarrow U_2 \dots U_n \rightarrow \Proc$ and its linear type 
%$U^1$
%which corresponds to $\shot{\tilde{U}}$ and $\lhot{\tilde{U}}$ in 
%a super-calculus of $\HOpp$ and $\PHOp$. 
%%in~\cite{MostrousY15} in the asynchronous setting.
%%The session type
%%system considered is influenced by the type systems for $\lambda$-calculi and
%%uses type syntax of the form $U_1 \rightarrow U_2 \dots U_n \rightarrow \Proc$
%%for shared values and $(U_1 \rightarrow U_2 \dots U_n \rightarrow \Proc)^{1}$
%%for linear values.
%%Such a type is expressed in $\HOpp$
%%terms using the type $\shot{U}$ (respectively, $\lhot{U}$)
%%with $U$ being a nested higher-order type; and 
%%the $\HOp$ uses only types of the form
%%$\shot{C}$ and $\lhot{C}$ with $C$ being a first-order channel type.
%Our results show that
%the calculus in~\cite{tlca07} is not only expressed but 
%also reasoned in 
%$\HO$ (with limited form of arrow types, $\shot{C}$ and $\lhot{C}$), via precise encodings. \dk{None of the above works proposes tractable 
%bisimulations for higher-order processes.}

%\myparagraph{Typed Behavioural Equivalences.}
\NY{Our work follows 
the 
%principles for
session type behavioural semantics in 
\cite{KYHH2015,KY2015,DBLP:journals/iandc/PerezCPT14}
where a bisimulation is defined on an LTS 
that assumes a session typed
observer.
%The bisimilarity is characterised by the corresponding
%reduction-closed, barbed congruence using techniques derived from~\cite{Hennessy07}.
Our theory for higher-order sessions 
differentiates from 
the work in~\cite{KYHH2015,KY2015}, which 
considers  (first-order)
binary and multiparty session types, respectively.
The work \cite{DBLP:journals/iandc/PerezCPT14} studies typed equivalences
for a 
theory of binary sessions based on linear logic,
without shared names.}
%Determinacy properties (confluence, $\tau$-inertness) are proven.
Our results have important consequences in the study of the relative expressiveness
of higher-order session processes; see the associated 
technical report~\cite{KouzapasPY15} for these further applications.


%The theory for higher-order session type quivalences is more challenging than
%their corresponding first-order bisimulation theory.
Our approach %for the higher-order 
to typed equivalences
builds upon techniques developed by Sangiorgi~\cite{SangiorgiD:expmpa,San96H}
and Jeffrey and Rathke~\cite{JeffreyR05}.
%The work %Sangiorgi as part of his Ph.D.~research
%%\cite{San96H,SangiorgiD:expmpa}
%\cite{SangiorgiD:expmpa}
%introduced the first fully-abstract encoding from the higher-order 
%$\pi$-calculus into the $\pi$-calculus. 
%Sangiorgi's encoding is based on the idea of a replicated input-guarded process 
%(a trigger process). 
%%We use a similar  replicated triggered process to encode \HOp into \sessp (\defref{d:enc:hopitopi}).
% Operational correspondence for
%the triggered encoding is shown using a context bisimulation
%with first-order labels.
As we have discussed, although contextual bisimilarity has a satisfactory discriminative power,
its use is hindered by the universal quantification on output clauses.
To deal with this issue, 
Sangiorgi proposes \emph{normal bisimilarity}, 
a tractable  equivalence without universal quantification. 
To prove that context and normal bisimilarities coincide,~\cite{SangiorgiD:expmpa} uses 
triggered processes.
%The encoding also motivates the definition of a form of
Triggered bisimulation is also defined on first-order labels
where the context bisimulation is restricted to arbitrary
trigger substitution. %rather than arbitrary process substitutions.
This
characterisation of context bisimilarity  was refined in~\cite{JeffreyR05} for
calculi with recursive types, not addressed in~\cite{San96H,SangiorgiD:expmpa} and
quite relevant in %our work (cf. \defref{d:enc:hopitoho}).
applications of session-based concurrency.
The
bisimulation in~\cite{JeffreyR05}
is based on an LTS  extended with trigger meta-notation.
%for a full higher-order $\pi$-calculus that allows
%higher-order applications.
As in~\cite{San96H,SangiorgiD:expmpa}, 
the LTS in~\cite{JeffreyR05}
observes first-order triggered values instead of
higher-order values, offering a more direct characterisation of contextual equivalence
and lifting the restriction to finite types.
We briefly contrast 
the approach in~\cite{JeffreyR05} and ours based on 
%\dk{higher-order ($\hwb$) and} 
characteristic  bisimilarity ($\fwb$):
\begin{enumerate}[$\bullet$]
%\begin{enumerate}[i.]
\item 
The LTS in~\cite{JeffreyR05} is enriched with extra labels for triggers;
an output action transition emits a trigger and introduces a parallel replicated trigger.
Our 
approach retains usual labels/transitions; in  case of output,
%our bisimilarities 
%$\hwb$ and 
$\fwb$
introduces a parallel
\emph{non-replicated} trigger.

\item Higher-order input in~\cite{JeffreyR05} involves 
the input of a trigger which reduces after substitution.
Rather than a trigger name, %our bisimulations  
%$\hwb$ and 
$\fwb$
decrees the input of a triggered value $\abs{z}\binp{t}{x} (\appl{x}{z})$.

\item Unlike~\cite{JeffreyR05}, 
%our 
$\fwb$ treats  
first- and higher-order values uniformly. %In the latter case, 
%Since the 
As the typed LTS distinguishes linear and shared values,
replicated closures are used only for shared values.

\item While in~\cite{JeffreyR05}   name matching   is
crucial to prove completeness of bisimilarity.
In our case, \HOp lacks name matching and 
%Contrarily 
%\jpc{In contrast,} 
we use session types: a characteristic value inhabiting a type enables the simplest form of interactions with the environment.

%We use the characteristic process interaction with the environment, exploiting session types.
%, i.e., instead of matching a name, we embed it into a process and then observe its behaviour.

%In~\cite{JeffreyR05}  a matching construct 
%is crucial to prove completeness of bisimilarity.
%Since our language lacks matching,
%we use session type information to obtain the simplest value that 
%enables interaction with the environment.
\end{enumerate}
\noi 
A comparison of our approach to that 
in~\cite{JeffreyR05} in a concrete, representative example
reveals how our approach is indeed more economical, in the sense that 
even if both techniques require the same number of transitions, our approach 
based on a refined LTS and characteristic bisimilarity 
requires less visible transitions and replicated processes. 
This means that linearity information does lead to simplified analyses, here 
represented by simpler coinductive witnesses in proofs of behavioral equivalence.
Full details for this comparison are given in \appref{app:jandr}.


The \emph{environmental bisimulations} given in~\cite{DBLP:conf/lics/SangiorgiKS07} 
%which 
%Sangiorgi et al.~\cite{DBLP:conf/lics/SangiorgiKS07}, 
use a higher-order LTS 
to define a bisimulation that stores the observer's knowledge; hence, observed actions are based on this knowledge
at any given time. This approach is enhanced in~\cite{DBLP:journals/cl/KoutavasH12}
where a mapping from constants to higher-order values is introduced. This 
allows to observe first-order values instead
of higher-order values. It differs from~\cite{San96H,JeffreyR05} in that 
the mapping between higher- and first-order values is no longer implicit.


%There are similarities and differences between of the characteristic bisimulation
%and the bisimulation as defined by Jeffrey and Rathke
%(below we use the meta-notation adopted in~\cite{JeffreyR05}):
%%
%\begin{enumerate}[i)]
%	\item	The output of a higher-order value $\abs{x}{Q}$ on name
%		$n$ in Jeffrey\&Rathke approach requires the output of
%		a fresh trigger name $t$ (notation $\tau_t$)
%		on name $n$ 
%		and then the introduction of a replicated triggered process
%		(notation $(t \Leftarrow (x) Q)$)
%		in the context of the acting process:
%		%
%		\[
%			P \by{\news{t} \bactout{n}{\tau_{t}}} P' \Par (t \Leftarrow (x) Q) \by{\bactinp{t}{v}} P' \Par \appl{(x) Q}{v} \Par (t \Leftarrow (x) Q) 
%		\]
%		%
%		In the characteristic bisimulation approach we only observe
%		an output of a value that can be either first- or higher-order:
%		%
%		\[
%			P \hby{\bactout{n}{V}} P' 
%		\]
%		%
%		with $V = \abs{x}{Q}$ or $V = m$.
%		A non-replicated triggered process appears in
%		the parallel context of the acting process when
%		we compare two processes for behavioural equality
%		(cf.~characteristic bisimulation \defref{d:fwb}),
%		$P' \Par \htrigger{t}{\abs{x}{Q}}$.
%		In fact using the LTS in
%		\defref{d:tlts} we can get:
%		%
%		\begin{eqnarray*}
%			P' \Par \htrigger{t}{\abs{x}{Q}}
%			&\by{\abs{z}{\binp{z}{y} \repl{} \binp{t}{x} \appl{y}{x}}}&
%			P' \Par \newsp{s}{\binp{s}{y} \repl{} \binp{t}{x} \appl{y}{x} \Par \bout{s}{\abs{x}{Q}} \inact}\\
%			&\by{\tau}&
%			P' \Par \repl{}\binp{t}{y} \appl{\abs{x}{Q}}{y}
%		\end{eqnarray*}
%		%
%		that simulates the Jeffrey\&Rathke approach.
%
%		The characteristic bisimulation differentiates from
%		the Jeffrey\&Rathke approach:
%		\begin{enumerate}[$\bullet$]
%			\item	The typed LTS predicts the case of linear
%				output values and will never allow replication
%				of such a value;
%				if $V$ is linear the input action would have no replication
%				operator, as
%				$\abs{z}{\binp{z}{y} \binp{t}{x} \appl{y}{x}}$.
%
%			\item	The characteristic bisimulation introduces a uniform approach
%				not only for
%				higher-order values but for first-order values
%				as well. A triggered process can accept any
%				process that can substitute a first-order value as well.
%				This is derived from the fact that the $\HOp$
%				calculus makes no use of a matching operator, in contrast
%				to the calculus defined in~\cite{JeffreyR05})
%				where name matching is crucial to prove completness
%				of the bisimilarity relation.
%				We chose not to include the matching operator
%				because of the requirement of a minimal calculus.
%				In the lack of matching we use types to inhabit
%				a value so we can observe its simplest interaction
%				with the process environment.
%
%			\item	The \HOp calculus requires only first-order
%				applications. Higher-order applications,
%				as in the Jeffrey\&Rathke work,
%				are presented as an extension in the \HOpp
%				calculus.
%
%			\item	The trigger process is non-replicated. In fact
%				the trigger process transforms guards the output
%				value with a higher-order input prefix. The
%				functionality of the input is used to
%				simulate the contextual bisimilarity that subsumes
%				the replicated trigger approach.
%				The transformation of an output action as an input
%				action allows for treating an output
%				using the restricted LTS \defref{def:rlts}:
%				%
%				\[
%					P' \Par \htrigger{t}{\abs{x}{Q}} \hby{\bactinp{t}{\abs{x}{\mapchar{U}{x}}}}
%					P' \Par \news{s}{ \appl{\mapchar{U}{x}}{s} \Par \bout{\dual{s}}{\abs{x}{Q}} \inact}
%				\]
%		\end{enumerate}
%		%
%		%In essence we are transforming a replicated trigger into a process
%		%that is input-prefixed on a fresh name that receives a higher-order
%		%value;
%
%	\item	The input of a higher-order value in the Jeffrey\&Rathke approach requires 
%		the input of a fresh trigger name, which is substituted on the application
%		variable, thus having a meta-suntax for triggered application instead
%		of higher-order applications:
%		%
%		\[
%			\binp{n}{x} P \by{\bactinp{n}{\tau_k}} \appl{\abs{x}{P}}{\tau_k} \by{\tau} P \subst{x}{\tau_k} 
%		\]
%		%
%		with every instance of process variable $x$ in $P$ being substituted
%		with trigger value $\tau_k$ to give a process of the form $\appl{\tau_k}{x}$.
%		The approach in the characteristic bisimulation observes the
%		triggered value
%		$\abs{z}\binp{t}{x} \appl{x}{z}$ as an input instead of the
%		trigger name:
%		%
%		\[
%			P \hby{\bactinp{n}{\abs{z}\binp{t}{x} \appl{x}{z}}} P \subst{\abs{z}\binp{t}{x} \appl{x}{z}}{x}
%		\]
%		%
%		with applications being transformed to
%		$\abs{z}{\binp{t}{x} \appl{x}{z}}{v}$
%		Note that in the characteristic bisimulation semantics
%		we can also observe a characteristic process as an input.
%		
%	\item 	Triggered application in the Jeffrey\&Rahtke
%		are observe using an output
%		lead into an output observation of the
%		application value over
%		the fresh trigger name.
%		%
%		\[
%			\appl{\tau_k}{v} \by{\bactout{k}{v}} \inact
%		\]
%		%
%		In the characteristic bisimulation instead of observing an 
%		application and its value as an action we observe:
%		i) the name of the trigger through the trigger value
%		application; and ii) the application
%		value by inhabiting it in the characteristic value
%		and observing the interaction of the corresponding
%		characteristic process with its environment.
%		%
%		\begin{eqnarray*}
%			\appl{\abs{z}{\binp{t}{x} \appl{x}{z}}}{v} &\by{\tau}& \binp{t}{x} \appl{x}{v}
%			\by{\bactinp{t}{\abs{x}{\mapchar{U}{x}}}}
%			\appl{\abs{x}{\mapchar{U}{x}}}{v}
%			\by{\tau} \mapchar{U}{x} \subst{n}{x}
%		\end{eqnarray*}
%		%
%\end{enumerate}

%The main differences of the triggered
%bisimulation approach comparing to our approach are:
%i) We use observe higher-order values on the LTS in contrast to first-order 
%values in~\cite{DBLP:journals/lmcs/JeffreyR05}.
%ii) In our approach we avoid the replicated triggered process,
%by transforming the output process into a higher-order guarded input.
%iii) The triggered bisimulation gives semantics for higher-order application,
%whereas in our approach we give semantics for first-order applications
%and show that higher-order applications are fully encodable.
