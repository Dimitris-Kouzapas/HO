This work proposes %efficient 
tractable
bisimulations 
for the higher-order $\pi$-calculus with session primitives~(\HOp).
We develop three typed bisimulations, which are shown to 
coincide with contextual equivalence.
These characterisations  
demonstrate that observing as inputs
only a specific finite set of higher-order values (which inhabit session types) suffices 
to reason about \HOp processes.
