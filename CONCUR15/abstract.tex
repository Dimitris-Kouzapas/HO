Obtaining 
tractable
characterisations of context equivalence is a long-standing problem for higher-order (process) languages. 
In the setting of the higher-order $\pi$-calculus with session primitives, 
we develop %efficient 
\emph{characteristic bisimilarity}, 
a tractable bisimulation 
here shown to  
coincide with contextual equivalence.
This  result crucially relies on elementary processes inhabiting session types, in 
sharp contrast to known techniques for untyped higher-order processes.
%In fact, our characterisation result
%demonstrates that observing as inputs
%only a specific finite set of higher-order values (which inhabit session types) suffices 
%to reason about \HOp processes.
