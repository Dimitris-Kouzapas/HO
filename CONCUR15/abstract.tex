Characterizing 
contextual equivalence is a long-standing issue for higher-order (process) languages. 
In the setting of a higher-order $\pi$-calculus with session primitives, 
we develop %efficient 
\emph{characteristic bisimilarity}, 
a typed bisimilarity  
which fully characterises contextual equivalence.
Using simple values inhabiting session types,
our approach distinguishes from methods for 
characterising contextual equivalence in
untyped higher-order processes:
we show that observing as inputs
only a precise finite set of higher-order values suffices 
to reason about higher-order session processes. 

%In fact, our characterisation result
%demonstrates that observing as inputs
%only a specific finite set of higher-order values (which inhabit session types) suffices 
%to reason about \HOp processes.
