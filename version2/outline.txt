OUTLINE
---------------------

1.	Define a HO session calculus.
2.	Identify two subcalculi:
	- Standard session calculus (no HO)
	- pure HO session calculus (no name passing)
3.	Develop an HO session type system.
4.	Develop behavioural theory:
	- Barb-preserving congruence
	- Contextual bisimulation
	- Non-contextual bisimulation
	- Prove that the relations are equal.
5.	Encodings:
	- Pure session calculus (with no recursion) into pure HO
	- Extend pure HO with more constructs that are encodable
	- Pure session calculus recursion into pure HO
	- pure HO into pure session calculus
	- explore the limits of encoding shared names into session names.
	- lambda calculus encoding (if we have time and space)
