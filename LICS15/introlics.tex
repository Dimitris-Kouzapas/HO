Key points:
\begin{enumerate}[1.]
	\item	Session $\pi$ calculus with process passing.
	\item	Identify session $\pi$ and process passing subcalculi and their polyadic variants.
	\item	Bisimulation theory for higher-order session semantics.
	\item	New triggered bisimulation, related to Jeffrey and Rathke's.
	\item   Elementary values key to characterizations of behavioral equivalence.
	\item	Types provide techniques to prove completeness without matching.
	\item	We are interested in encodings with properties a la Gorla. 
                We extended them to typed setting. 
	\item	Encode name-passing to pure process abstraction calculus, with name abstractions.
	\item	Type of the recursion encoding uses non tail recursive type $\trec{t}{\btinp{t} \tinact}$.
	\item	Encode higher-order semantics to first order semantics.
	\item	Negative result. Cannot encode shared names using only shared names.
	\item   Extensions with higher-order abstractions and polyadicity also explored.

Explain our \HO is very small without containg name passing 
\[ 
\abs{x}.P \quad \appl{x}{u}
\]

Explain we input only characteristic processes.  

\[
\lambda x.\mapchar{S}{x}
\]
