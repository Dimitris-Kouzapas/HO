\subsection{Higher-Order Session Calculi}
\noi By combining features from the $\lambda$-calculus and the $\pi$-calculus, 
\emph{higher-order process calculi} enable the communication of values containing 
processes. In this paper, we consider higher-order calculi with \emph{session primitives},
thus enabling the specification of sequences of reciprocal exchanges (protocols)
which can be verified via type-checking using \emph{session types}~\cite{honda.vasconcelos.kubo:language-primitives}.
Therefore, the process languages that we consider here allow us to specify   
session protocols in which higher-order values 
(mobile code) can be exchanged; naturally governed by session types, 
such protocols cleanly distinguish between 
linear and unrestricted behaviors in 
directed %point-to-point 
communications.

The study of higher-order concurrency has received significant attention, 
from typed and untyped perspectives.
%in particular via  comparisons with the first-order mobility of the $\pi$-calculus~\cite{MilnerR:calmp1}. 
Although models of session-typed 
communications with features of higher-order concurrency exist~\cite{tlca07,DBLP:journals/jfp/GayV10},
several aspects of their theory 
have yet to be understood. To this end, here we study
 \emph{tractable behavioral equivalences} and \emph{relative expressiveness}
for higher-order session calculi. 
These two issues 
have been throughly studied
%are well-understood 
for higher-order languages without sessions,
but not for higher-order process calculi with sessions.
This is unfortunate, given the wide applicability of session-based concurrency; indeed,
session types are expressive enough to describe complex 
communication structures found in practical protocols,  expressible, e.g., via recursive session types.
Clarifying the status of typed equivalences and relative expressiveness for session languages
may play a vital role in justifying non-trivial protocol optimizations and in transferring key reasoning techniques between session calculi.

The main higher-order language in our work, denoted \HOp,
extends the higher-order $\pi$-calculus~\cite{SangiorgiD:expmpa} with session primitives:
it contains constructs for session establishment
(synchronization on shared names), 
recursion, 
name abstractions/applications (i.e., functions from name identifiers to processes, call-by-value style),
and session communication (value passing and
labeled choice using linear names). 
Two significant subcalculi of \HOp restrict to higher- and first-order mobility:
while the \HO calculus is \HOp without recursion and name passing,
the \sessp calculus is \HOp without abstractions and applications.
Thus, 
while $\sessp$ is in essence the calculus in~\cite{honda.vasconcelos.kubo:language-primitives}, 
\HO  is  the
core calculus for higher-order session concurrency.

In the first part of the paper, we address tractable behavioral equivalences
for \HOp.
A well-studied behavioral equivalence in the higher-order setting is \emph{contextual bisimulation},
a labelled characterization of barbed congruence 
which offers an appropriate discriminative power at the price of universal quantifications in output clauses.
The definition of alternative characterizations that alleviate this burden
is then a recurring issue 
in the study of higher-order processes equivalences.
Our approach to this problem 
exploits the protocol specifications given by session types to  limit 
the behavior of higher-order session processes. 
Exploiting elementary processes inhabiting session types, 
this limitation is formally enforced by 
a refined (typed) labelled transition system (LTS)
that narrows down the spectrum of allowed process behaviors, 
thus naturally enabling tractable reasoning techniques. 
Two tractable characterizations of bisimilarity, 
targeted to higher- and first-order session processes,
are shown to coincide with contextual bisimilarity.

Then, in the second part of the paper we assess the expressive 
power of \HOp, \HO, and \sessp as delineated by typing. 
We establish strong correspondences between 
these languages via fully abstract encodings. 
Here again having the name usage information given by session types is fundamental to define the encodings
and to state their semantic correspondences.
That is, our encodings relate source and target processes
endowed with proper communication structures as described by session types. 
We introduce a notion of encoding that 
requires the translation of both process and types and 
formally captures preservation of (session) typing,
both for processes and for typing judgments. 
A further expressivity result shows that shared names, 
as required in the session establishment phase,
 strictly add expressive power 
to session calculi. 

In the remainder of the introduction, we motivate further our contributions,
giving details of the technical challenges involves.

\subsection{Tractable Bisimilarities for Session-Typed Processes}
\label{subsec:intro:bisimulation}
\noi 
\myparagraph{Overcoming Limitations of Contextual Bisimulation.}
Contextual bisimilarity ($\wbc$, Def.~\ref{def:wbc}) is 
%a straightforward 
labelled characterisation of contextual congruence 
\cite{SaWabook}. 
Unfortunately, it is a too demanding relation on processes. 
%In the following we motivate our
%proposal for alternative, more tractable characterisations.  
%For the sake of clarity, and to emphasise the novelties of our approach, 
%we often omit type information. 
%Formal definitions including types are in \S\,\ref{sec:behavioural}.
To see the problem, we show 
the following clause for output.
Suppose $P \,\Re\, Q$, for some context bisimulation $\Re$. Then:

\smallskip 

\begin{enumerate}[$(\star)$]
\item Whenever 
$P \by{\news{\tilde{m_1}} \bactout{n}{V}} P'$
there exist
$Q'$ and $W$
such that 
$Q \by{\news{\tilde{m_2}} \bactout{n}{W}} Q'$
and, for all $R$ with $\fv{R}=x$, 
$\newsp{\tilde{m_1}}{P' \Par R\subst{V}{x}} \,\Re\, \newsp{\tilde{m_2}}{Q' \Par R\subst{W}{x}}$
\end{enumerate}
\smallskip 
\noi 
Above, 
$\news{\tilde{m_1}} \bactout{n}{V}$ is the output label of 
value $V$ with extrusion of names in $\tilde{m_1}$.
To reduce the burden induced by 
universal quantification, we introduce \emph{higher-order}  and 
\emph{characteristic}  
bisimulations, two tractable equivalences denoted  $\hwb$ and $\fwb$, respectively.
We shall aim at limiting the input 
labelled transition system (LTS)  so that we can define a
bisimulation relation for the output clause without observing
infinitely many actions on the same input prefix. 
To this end, we take the following two steps: 
%
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
	\item We replace $(\star)$ with a clause involving a more tractable process closure.
	\item We refine the transition rule for input in the LTS.
\end{enumerate}
%
\smallskip

\myparagraph{Trigger Processes with Session Communication.}
Concerning~(a), we exploit session types. 
We 
first 
observe that closure $R\subst{V}{x}$ 
in $(\star)$
is contextually bisimilar to the process
\begin{equation}\label{equ:1}
P = \newsp{s}{\appl{(\abs{z}{\binp{z}{x}{R}})}{s} \Par \bout{\dual{s}}{V} \inact}
\end{equation}
\noi where $\binp{z}{x}{R}$ is an input and $\bout{\dual{s}}{V} \inact$
is an output 
on the endpoint $\dual{s}$ (the dual of $s$).
In fact,
we have $P \wbc R\subst{V}{x}$, 
since 
application and reduction of dual endpoints 
%($s$ and $\dual{s}$) 
are deterministic.  
Now consider the process $T_{V}$ below, where $t$ is a fresh name:
\begin{equation}\label{equ:0}
T_{V} = \hotrigger{t}{V}
\end{equation}
%We call $\abs{z}{\binp{z}{x} R}$ a {\bf\em trigger value}. 
If $T_{V}$ inputs $\abs{z}{\binp{z}{x} R}$
we can simulate the closure of $P$:
\begin{equation}\label{equ:2}
%\hotrigger{t}{V_1} 
T_{V}
\by{\bactinp{t}{\abs{z}{\binp{z}{x} R}}} P 
\wbc 
R\subst{V}{x}
\end{equation}
Processes such as $T_{V}$ 
offer a value at a fresh name; we will use this class of 
{\bf\em trigger processes} to define a
 refined bisimilarity without the demanding 
output clause $(\star)$. Given a fresh name $t$, 
we write $\htrigger{t}{V}$ to 
stand for a trigger process $T_{V}$ for value $V$.
We note that 
in contrast to previous approaches~\cite{SaWabook,JeffreyR05} 
our {trigger processes} do {\em not} use recursion or 
replication. This is crucial for preserving linearity of session names.  

\smallskip

%Then we can use 
%$\newsp{\tilde{m_1}}{P_1 \Par \htrigger{t}{V_1}}$ instead 
%of Clause 1) in Definition \ref{def:wbc} if we input 
%$\abs{z}{\binp{z}{x} R}$.   

\myparagraph{Characteristic Processes.}
Concerning (b), we shall limit the possible $R$ processes by
exploiting the structure of session types.
The key concept is that of {\bf \emph{characteristic process}} 
(Def.~\ref{def:char}). 
The characteristic process of 
a session type $S$ is the 
simplest process inhabiting $S$. 
This way, e.g., if $S = \btinp{\shot{S_1}} \btout{S_2} \tinact$
(input a function from values $S_1$ to processes, then output a value of type $S_2$)
then process $Q = \binp{u}{x} (\bout{u}{s_2} \inact \Par \appl{x}{s_1})$
is a characteristic process for $S$.
Thus, characteristic processes follow the communication structures decreed by session types.
Given a session type $S$, we write $\mapchar{S}{u} $ for its characteristic process along name $u$.
In general, 
the definition
extends to  value types $U$ and so we write $\mapchar{U}{u}$.

We use characteristic processes to limit input transitions.
Precisely, we exploit  the
{\bf\em characteristic value} $\lambda x.\mapchar{U}{x}$. %$\lambda x.\mapchar{U}{x}$. 
If we follow the same reasoning as (\ref{equ:1})--(\ref{equ:2}), 
we can use an alternative trigger process, called
{\bf\em characteristic trigger process} with type 
$U$ to replace clause
% (1) in Definition~\ref{def:wbc}:
($\star$) in Def.~\ref{def:wbc}:
\begin{equation}
	\label{eq:4}
	\ftrigger{t}{V}{U} \defeq \fotrigger{t}{x}{s}{\btinp{U} \tinact}{V}
\end{equation}

%Note that if $U=L$, $\ftrigger{t}{V}{U}$ subsumes 
%$\htrigger{t}{V}$. 
\noi To refine the input transition system, we need to observe 
an additional value, 
$\abs{{x}}{\binp{t}{y} (\appl{y}{{x}})}$, 
called the {\bf\em trigger value}. 
This is necessary, because it turns out
that a characteristic value 
alone as the observable input 
is not enough to define meaningful bisimulations.
Roughly speaking, the trigger value is used 
to {\em count} the number of free higher-order variables inside 
the receiver. In Example~\ref{ex:motivation} we explain the details. 

\smallskip 
\myparagraph{Refined Input Transition Rule.}
The above discussion justifies the refinement of the transition 
rule for input actions. 
We write $P \by{\bactinp{n}{V}} P'$ for the input transition along $n$ (early style).
The transition rule for input roughly becomes 
(see Def.~\ref{def:rlts} for a precise definition):
\[
		\tree {
%\begin{array}{c}
P \by{\bactinp{n}{V}} P' \quad  V  \scong
(\abs{{x}}{\binp{t}{y} (\appl{y}{{x}})}
 \vee  \abs{{x}}{\map{U}^{{x}}}  \vee m)  \textrm{ with } t \textrm{ fresh} 
		}{
			P' \hby{\bactinp{n}{V}} P'
		}
\]
Observe the notations for standard and refined transitions: $\by{\bactinp{n}{V}}$ vs. $\hby{\bactinp{n}{V}}$.
Using this rule, we define an alternative  LTS
with refined input; all other rules are kept unchanged.
This refined LTS is used for 
both higher-order ($\hwb$) and characteristic ($\fwb$) bisimulations,
which replace the demanding clause~$(\star)$ with 
more tractable clauses based on trigger processes and characteristic 
trigger processes, respectively (Defs.~\ref{d:hbw} and \ref{d:fwb}).
Later we show $\hwb$ is useful for \HOp and \HO, but 
$\fwb$ is uniformly useful for all subcalculi including the 
first-order session $\pi$-calculus. 
%Notice that while Definition \ref{d:hbw} is useful for 
%\HOp and its higher-order variants,
%Definition \ref{d:fwb} is useful for first-order sub-calculi of \HOp.
