\subsection{Higher-Order Session Calculi}
\noi By combining constructs from the $\lambda$-calculus and the $\pi$-calculus, 
\emph{higher-order process calculi} enable the communication of values containing 
processes. In this paper, we consider higher-order calculi with ~\emph{session primitives},
thus enabling  sequences of reciprocal exchanges abstracted by \emph{session types}.
Therefore, the languages under consideration allow us to express communication predefined 
protocols in which higher-order values 
(mobile code) can be exchanged; naturally stipulated by types, 
such protocols precisely distinguish between 
linear and unrestricted behaviors in 
directed %point-to-point 
communications.

The study of higher-order concurrency has received significant attention, 
both from typed and untyped perspectives, 
in particular via 
comparisons with the first-order mobility of the $\pi$-calculus. Although models of session 
communications with higher-order values have also been proposed~\cite{Mostrous,VascoSimon},
their theory is much less developed.
To remedy this, here we study
 \emph{tractable behavioral equivalences} and \emph{relative expressiveness}
for higher-order session calculi. 
These two issues are well-understood for higher-order languages without sessions,
but not for higher-order process calculi with sessions.
This is unfortunate, given the wide applicability of session-based concurrency; indeed,
the protocol abstractions offered by 
session types include 
complex 
iterative communication structures found in practice,  expressible via recursive session types.
Hence, clarifying the status of typed equivalences and relative expressiveness for session languages
may play a vital role in enabling/justifying non-trivial protocol optimizations and in transferring key reasoning techniques between session calculi.

The main higher-order session calculus in our work is denoted \HOp.
This calculus extends the higher-order $\pi$-calculus~\cite{SangiorgiD:expmpa} with session primitives, i.e., 
it contains constructs for session establishment
(i.e., synchronization between shared names), recursion, 
name abstractions/applications (i.e., functions from name identifiers to processes, call-by-value style),
session communication, 
labeled choice (i.e., two forms of synchronization between linear names).
Two significant subcalculi of \HOp restrict to higher- and first-order mobility:
while the \HO calculus is \HOp without recursion and name passing,
the \sessp calculus is \HOp without higher-order constructs (abstraction and application).
Thus, the calculus $\sessp$ is assimilable to the calculus in~\cite{HVK}, widely studied in the literature;
the \HO calculus is a truly minimal formalization of higher-order session concurrency.
Extensions of \HOp with polyadic communication and higher-order abstractions 
(i.e., functions from full values to processes) are also considered.

In the first part of the paper, we address tractable behavioral equivalences
for higher-order session processes.


\subsection{Tractable Bisimilarities for Session-Typed Processes}
\label{subsec:intro:bisimulation}
\noi 
\myparagraph{Overcoming Limitations of Contextual Bisimulation.}
Contextual bisimilarity ($\wbc$, Definition~\ref{def:wbc}) is 
a straightforward labelled characterisation of contextual congruence 
\cite{SaWabook}. 
Unfortunately, it is a too demanding relation on processes. 
%In the following we motivate our
%proposal for alternative, more tractable characterisations.  
%For the sake of clarity, and to emphasise the novelties of our approach, 
%we often omit type information. 
%Formal definitions including types are in \S\,\ref{sec:behavioural}.
To see the problem, we show 
the following clause for output.
Suppose $P \,\Re\, Q$, for some context bisimulation $\Re$. Then:

\smallskip 

\begin{enumerate}[$(\star)$]
\item Whenever 
$P \by{\news{\tilde{m_1}} \bactout{n}{V}} P'$
there exist
$Q'$ and $W$
such that 
$Q \by{\news{\tilde{m_2}} \bactout{n}{W}} Q'$
and, for all $R$ with $\fv{R}=x$, 
$\newsp{\tilde{m_1}}{P' \Par R\subst{V}{x}} \,\Re\, \newsp{\tilde{m_2}}{Q' \Par R\subst{W}{x}}$
\end{enumerate}
\smallskip 
\noi 
Above, 
$\news{\tilde{m_1}} \bactout{n}{V}$ is the output label of 
value $V$ with extrusion of names in $\tilde{m_1}$.
To reduce the burden induced by 
universal quantification, we introduce \emph{higher-order}  and 
\emph{characteristic}  
bisimulations, two tractable equivalences denoted  $\hwb$ and $\fwb$, respectively.
We shall aim at limiting the input 
labelled transition system (LTS)  so that we can define a
bisimulation relation for the output clause without observing
infinitely many actions on the same input prefix. 
To this end, we take the following two steps: 
%
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
	\item We replace $(\star)$ with a clause involving a more tractable process closure.
	\item We refine the transition rule for input in the LTS.
\end{enumerate}
%
\myparagraph{Trigger Processes with Session Communication.}
Concerning~(a), we exploit session types. 
We 
first 
observe that closure $R\subst{V}{x}$ 
in $(\star)$
is contextually bisimilar to the process
\begin{equation}\label{equ:1}
P = \newsp{s}{\appl{(\abs{z}{\binp{z}{x}{R}})}{s} \Par \bout{\dual{s}}{V} \inact}
\end{equation}
\noi where $\binp{z}{x}{R}$ is an input and $\bout{\dual{s}}{V} \inact$
is an output 
on the endpoint $\dual{s}$ (the dual of $s$).
In fact,
we have $P \wbc R\subst{V}{x}$, 
since 
application and reduction between two dual endpoints 
($s$ and $\dual{s}$) are deterministic.  
Now consider the process $T_{V}$ below, where $t$ is a fresh name:
\begin{equation}\label{equ:0}
T_{V} = \hotrigger{t}{V}
\end{equation}
%We call $\abs{z}{\binp{z}{x} R}$ a {\bf\em trigger value}. 
If $T_{V}$ inputs $\abs{z}{\binp{z}{x} R}$
we can simulate the closure of $P$:
\begin{equation}\label{equ:2}
%\hotrigger{t}{V_1} 
T_{V}
\by{\bactinp{t}{\abs{z}{\binp{z}{x} R}}} P 
\wbc 
R\subst{V}{x}
\end{equation}
Processes such as $T_{V}$ 
offer a value at a fresh name; we will use this class of 
{\bf\em trigger processes} to define a
 refined bisimilarity without the demanding 
output clause $(\star)$. Given a fresh name $t$, 
we write $\htrigger{t}{V}$ to 
stand for a trigger process $T_{V}$ for value $V$.
We note that 
in contrast to previous approaches~\cite{SaWabook,JeffreyR05} 
our {trigger processes} do {\em not} use recursion or 
replication. This is crucial for preserving linearity of session names.  

%Then we can use 
%$\newsp{\tilde{m_1}}{P_1 \Par \htrigger{t}{V_1}}$ instead 
%of Clause 1) in Definition \ref{def:wbc} if we input 
%$\abs{z}{\binp{z}{x} R}$.   

\myparagraph{Characteristic Processes.}
Concerning (b), we shall limit the possible $R$ processes by
exploiting the structure of session types.
The key concept is that of a {\bf \emph{characteristic process}} 
(Definition~\ref{def:char}). 
The characteristic process of 
a session type $S$ is the 
simplest process inhabiting $S$. 
This way, e.g., if $S = \btinp{\shot{S_1}} \btout{S_2} \tinact$
(input a function from values $S_1$ to processes, then output a value of type $S_2$)
then process $Q = \binp{u}{x} (\bout{u}{s_2} \inact \Par \appl{x}{s_1})$
is a characteristic process for $S$.
Thus, characteristic processes follow the communication structures decreed by session types.
Given a session type $S$, we write $\mapchar{S}{u} $ for its characteristic process along name $u$.
In general, 
the definition
extends to  value types $U$ and so we write $\mapchar{U}{u}$.

We use characteristic processes to limit input transitions.
More precisely, we exploit  the
{\bf\em characteristic value}, denoted $\lambda x.\mapchar{U}{x}$. %$\lambda x.\mapchar{U}{x}$. 
If we follow the same reasoning as (\ref{equ:1})--(\ref{equ:2}), 
we can use an alternative trigger process, called
{\bf\em characteristic trigger process} with type 
$U$ to replace clause (1) in Definition~\ref{def:wbc}:
\begin{equation}
	\label{eq:4}
	\ftrigger{t}{V}{U} \defeq \fotrigger{t}{x}{s}{\btinp{U} \tinact}{V}
\end{equation}

%Note that if $U=L$, $\ftrigger{t}{V}{U}$ subsumes 
%$\htrigger{t}{V}$. 
\noi To refine the input transition system, we need to observe 
an additional value, 
$\abs{{x}}{\binp{t}{y} (\appl{y}{{x}})}$, 
called the {\bf\em trigger value}. 
This is necessary, because it turns out
that a characteristic value 
alone as the observable input 
is not enough to define meaningful bisimulations.
Roughly speaking, the trigger value is used 
to {\em count} the number of free higher-order variables inside 
the receiver (Example~\ref{ex:motivation} explains the details). 
%as the following example illustrates.
%\begin{example}[The Need for Refined Typed LTS]
%%\label{ex:motivation}
%%We show that either a characteristic value or 
%%a trigger value alone as the observable input 
%%is not enough to define meaningful bisimulations.
%%(to justify rule \eltsrule{RRcv} in Definition~\ref{def:rlts} in the next paragraph). 
%%
%First we demonstrate that a characteristic value is not sufficient. 
%Consider the typed processes $P_1, P_2$:
%%
%\begin{eqnarray}
%	P_1 = \binp{s}{x} (\appl{x}{s_1} \Par \appl{x}{s_2}) & ~~&
%	P_2 = \binp{s}{x} (\appl{x}{s_1} \Par \binp{s_2}{y} \inact) 
%	\label{equ:6}
%\end{eqnarray}
%%
%We can show that 
%the session type for $s$ in $P_1$ and $P_2$ is 
%$s: \btinp{\shot{\btinp{C} \tinact}} \tinact$.
%If $P_1$ and $P_2$ 
%receive 
%the characteristic value $\abs{z}{\binp{z}{y}} \inact$ along $x$, 
%then they will evolve into %(\ref{eq:5}) and (\ref{eq:6}) in become:
%%
%\begin{eqnarray*}
%	\binp{s_1}{y} \inact \Par \binp{s_2}{y} \inact \hastype \Proc
%\end{eqnarray*}
%%
%therefore becoming 
%contextually bisimilar after the input of
% $\abs{x}{\binp{x}{y}} \inact$.
%However, the processes in \eqref{equ:6}
%are clearly {\em not} contextually bisimilar: there exist many input actions
%which may be used to distinguish them.
%For example, if 
%$P_1$ and $P_2$ input 
% $\abs{x} \bout{a}{s_3} \binp{x}{y} \inact$ then
%their derivatives are not bisimilar. 

%Observing only the characteristic value 
%results in an over-discriminating bisimulation.
%However, if a trigger value is received, 
%then we can distinguish 
%processes in \eqref{equ:6}:  
%%
%\begin{eqnarray*}
%%	\Gamma; \es; \Delta &\proves& 
%	P_1 \by{\ell} \binp{t}{x} \appl{x}{s_1} \Par \binp{t}{x} \appl{x}{s_2} 
%%\hastype \Proc
%	\mbox{~~and~~}
%%	\Gamma; \es; \Delta &\proves& 
%	P_2 \by{\ell} \binp{t}{x} \appl{x}{s_1} \Par \binp{s_2}{y} \inact 
%%\hastype \Proc
%\end{eqnarray*}
%%\noi resulting two distinct processes.  
%%
%where $\ell$ stands for the input of the trigger value
%$\abs{{x}}{\binp{t}{y} (\appl{y}{{x}})}$.
%One question that arises here is whether the trigger value is enough
%to distinguish two processes, hence no need of 
%characteristic values as the input. 
%This is not the case, since considering the trigger value
%alone also results in an over-discriminating bisimulation relation.
%In fact, the input trigger can be observed on any input prefix
%of {\em any type}. For example, consider the following processes:
%%
%\begin{eqnarray}
%	 \newsp{s}{\binp{n}{x} \appl{x}{s} \Par \bout{\dual{s}}{\abs{x} P} \inact} \label{equ:7}
%	\\
%	 \newsp{s}{\binp{n}{x} \appl{x}{s} \Par \bout{\dual{s}}{\abs{x} Q} \inact} \label{equ:8}
%\end{eqnarray}
%%
%\noi 
%Upon reception of the trigger abstraction, 
%processes \eqref{equ:7} and \eqref{equ:8}
%would evolve to 
%%input the trigger value, we obtain: % they evolved to 
%\begin{eqnarray*}
%%\Gamma; \es; \Delta \proves 
%	\newsp{s}{\binp{t}{x} \appl{x}{s} \Par \bout{\dual{s}}{\abs{x} P} \inact} 
%%\hastype \Proc
%	\mbox{~~and~~}
%%      \\
%%\Gamma; \es; \Delta \proves 
%	\newsp{s}{\binp{t}{x} \appl{x}{s} \Par \bout{\dual{s}}{\abs{x} Q} \inact}
%%\hastype \Proc
%\end{eqnarray*}
%%
%%\noi It is easy to obtain a closure if allow only the
%%trigger value as the input value.
%Then, 
%if both these processes input the trigger value $\abs{z}{\binp{z}{x} (\appl{x}{m})}$,  
%then they would become:
%\begin{eqnarray*}
%\Gamma; \es; \Delta \proves \newsp{s}{\binp{s}{x} \appl{x}{m} \Par \bout{\dual{s}}{\abs{x} P} \inact} \wbc \Delta \proves P \subst{m}{x}
%	\\
%\Gamma; \es; \Delta \proves \newsp{s}{\binp{s}{x} \appl{x}{m} \Par \bout{\dual{s}}{\abs{x} Q} \inact} \wbc \Delta \proves Q \subst{m}{x}
%\end{eqnarray*}
%\noi which are not bisimilar if $P \subst{m}{x} \not\wb Q \subst{m}{x}$.
%%\qed
%%In conclusion, these examples explain a need of both 
%%trigger and characteristic values 
%%as an input observation in the input transition relation (\eltsrule{RRcv})
%%which will be defined in Definition~\ref{def:rlts}.  
%\end{example}

%%\smallskip 
\myparagraph{Refined Input Transition Rule.}
The above discussion justifies the refinement of the transition 
rule for input actions. 
We write $P \by{\bactinp{n}{V}} P'$ for the usual input transition along $n$ (early style).
The new transition rule for input looks as the rule 
given below (see Definition~\ref{def:rlts} for a precise definition):
\[
		\tree {
%\begin{array}{c}
P \by{\bactinp{n}{V}} P' \quad  V  \scong
(\abs{{x}}{\binp{t}{y} (\appl{y}{{x}})}
 \vee  \abs{{x}}{\map{U}^{{x}}}  \vee m)  \textrm{ with } t \textrm{ fresh} 
		}{
			P' \hby{\bactinp{n}{V}} P'
		}
\]
Observe the notations for standard and refined transitions: $\by{\bactinp{n}{V}}$ vs. $\hby{\bactinp{n}{V}}$.
Using this rule, we define an alternative (typed) LTS
with refined input; all other rules are kept unchanged.
This refined LTS is used for 
both higher-order ($\hwb$) and characteristic ($\fwb$) bisimulations
where where we replace the demanding clause $(\star)$ with 
more tractable clauses based on trigger processes and characteristic 
trigger processes, respectively (Definitions \ref{d:hbw} and \ref{d:fwb}).
Later we show $\hwb$ is useful for \HOp and \HO, but 
$\fwb$ is uniformly useful for all subcalculi including the 
first-order session $\pi$-calculus. 
%Notice that while Definition \ref{d:hbw} is useful for 
%\HOp and its higher-order variants,
%Definition \ref{d:fwb} is useful for first-order sub-calculi of \HOp.
