This section studies two extensions of \HOp, 
polyadic (\PHO)
and arbitrariry higher-order applications (\HOpp).

\myparagraph{Syntax, Operational Semantics and Types}
\noi First, the syntax of Fig.~\ref{fig:syntax} extends 
$\appl{x}{u}$ to 
 $\appl{x}{V}$, including higher-order value $V$. 
We then replace rule $\orule{App}$ in Fig.~\ref{fig:reduction}
with rule $\appl{(\abs{x}{P})}{V} \red P \subst{V}{x}$.
The syntax of types changes to include: 
\[ L \bnfis \shot{U} \bnfbar \lhot{U}\]  
We apply the straightforward extension of the typing  
system to accomodate the new type syntax (see Appendix \ref{app:types}).

\myparagraph{ Behavioural Semantics.}
Labels remain the same. Rule $\ltsrule{App}$ in the untyped LTS
is replaced with rule $\appl{\abs{x}{P}}{V} \by{\tau} P \subst{V}{x}$.
The definition of the
characteristic process is extended to include
