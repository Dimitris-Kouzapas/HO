We present two encodings:
\begin{enumerate}
\item The first-order name-passing communication with recursions into 
the higher-order communication without name-passing nor 
recursions (\S\,\ref{ss:ffotoho})
\item the higher-order communication without 
name-passing and recursions into the first-order name-passing communication
with recursions (\S\,\ref{ss:hotofo})
\end{enumerate}
By (1), we can encode \HOp into \HO, hence \HOp can be encoded into 
$\sessp$. Note that it is obvious that $\sessp$ can be encoded into \HOp
by the identitiy mapping.
