\section{Introduction}
Expressiveness studies for process calculi not only shed light on the intrinsic properties of the models at hand; they
also offer formal justification to the reuse and transference of reasoning techniques between different communication disciplines.
This work presents an expressiveness study of \emph{higher-order} (or \emph{process passing}) concurrency in the setting of \emph{session types}, 
a rich behavioral type discipline for communicating processes.
