This paper studies issues of \emph{relative expressiveness} for session-typed calculi with \emph{higher-order concurrency}.
These are languages for concurrency in which communication objects may include processes, by adhering to structured protocols specified as \emph{session types}. By building upon a novel notion of \emph{typed encoding}, we identify and formalize several relations of relative expressiveness between different session $\pi$-calculi with process-passing features.
