This work studies the expressiveness of a family of first-order and
higher-order $\pi$-calculi, fully exploring 
features of session communication. 
We identify a core higher-order calculus with session 
primitives (the \HO calculus) which 
does not feature higher-order applications and session delegations,  
and show that it can encode the \HO calculus with 
applications and delegations,  
fully abstractly. 
We then show that the session $\pi$-calculus can encode 
the \HO calculus fully abstractly.  
We also prove a
non-encodability result from the session $\pi$-calculus
with shared name passing into the \HO calculus. 
Furthermore, we develop a typed bisimulation for each calculus  
and prove a coincidence with a corresponding contextual equivalence. 
The results highlight how shared names 
separate the expressivity of higher-order session calculi
and make it more difficult to reason about process equivalences. 
%First, we identify a core higher-order,
%session-typed calculus and develop its characterisations of typed
%contextual equivalences as labeled bisimilarities.  Second, we
%formalize (non) encodability results between session calculi with
%either name-passing or process-passing mechanisms. Our results
%clarify the relationship between name- and process-passing in terms of
%high-level communication structures based on types.


%In calculi for \emph{higher-order} concurrency, values exchanged as communication objects may include processes. Based on process passing, this paradigm is in contrast with the \emph{first-order} (or name passing) concurrency of the $\pi$-calculus. %based on name passing. 
%%The higher-order paradigm is sometimes consideredBy combining mechanisms for functional and concurrent computation, these languages offer a unified account of different forms of interaction. 
%Although previous works have related calculi for higher-order and first-order concurrency, little is known about the nature of this relationship when interactions are disciplined by \emph{types for structured communications}. Here we tackle this challenge from the perspective of \emph{session types}, focusing on \emph{typed behavioral equivalences} and issues of \emph{relative expressiveness}. First, we identify a core higher-order, session-typed calculus and develop for it  characterizations of typed contextual equivalences as labeled bisimilarities. 
%Second, we formalize (non) encodability results between session calculi with either name-passing or process-passing mechanisms. 
%Our results clarify the relationship between name- and process-passing in terms of high-level communication structures based on types.
