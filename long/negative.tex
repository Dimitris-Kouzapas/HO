\section{Negative Results}

In the encoding from $\HO$ to $\sesp$ we showed that
an easy and straightforward encoding would be to create
a new shared name for every abstraction we want to pass
in order to use it as a trigger that activate copies of
the abstraction.

At this point a reasonable question could be whether we can
encode shared name behaviour to session name behaviour and at
the same time maintain the type, operational and behavioural semantics.
If such result holds then its impact would be much bigger than
the encoding from $\HO$ to $\sesp$, since it would
allow us to have session type systems without shared names
and still have the modelling convenience of shared names.

In this section we prove the intution among researches 
that a semantic preserving encoding between a calculus
with shared names and a calculus with only session names
does not exist.

\begin{theorem}{}\rm
	There is no encoding $\enc{\cdot}{\cdot}: \sesp \longrightarrow \HO$
	that enjoys operational correspondence and full abstraction.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
	Let $\Gamma_1; \emptyset; \Sigma_1 \not\wb \Sigma_2 \proves P_1 \not\wb P_2 $
	with $P = \breq{a}{s} \inact \Par \bacc{a}{x} P_1 \Par \bacc{a}{x} P_2$ and
	let $\Gamma; \emptyset; \Sigma \proves P \hastype \Proc$.
	Assume also a encoding
	$\enc{\cdot}{\cdot}: \sesp \longrightarrow \HO$
	that enjoys
	operational correspondence and full abstraction.

	From operational correspondence we get that:
	\begin{eqnarray*}
		P \red P_1 \Par \bacc{a}{x} P_2 &\textrm{implies}& \map{P} \red \map{P_1 \Par \bacc{a}{x} P_2}\\
		P \red P_2 \Par \bacc{a}{x} P_1 &\textrm{implies}& \map{P} \red \map{P_2 \Par \bacc{a}{x} P_1}
	\end{eqnarray*}

	From the fact that
	$\Gamma_1; \emptyset; \Sigma_1 \not\wb \Sigma_2 \proves P_1 \not\wb P_2$
	we can derive that
	\[
		\Gamma_1'; \emptyset; \Sigma_1' \not\wb \Sigma_2' \proves P_1 \Par \bacc{a}{x} P_2 \not\wb P_2 \Par \bacc{a}{x} P_1
	\]

	From Lemma~\ref{lem:tau_inert} we know that
	\begin{eqnarray*}
		\mapt{\Gamma}; \emptyset; \mapt{\Sigma} \wb \mapt{\Sigma_1'} \proves \map{P} &\wb& \map{P_1 \Par \bacc{a}{x} P_2}\\
		\mapt{\Gamma}; \emptyset; \mapt{\Sigma} \wb \mapt{\Sigma_2'} \proves \map{P} &\wb& \map{P_2 \Par \bacc{a}{x} P_1}
	\end{eqnarray*}
	\noi thus
	\[
		\map{P_1 \Par \bacc{a}{x} P_2} \wb \map{P_2 \Par \bacc{a}{x} P_1}
	\]
	From here we conclude that the full abstraction property does not hold,
	which is a contradiction.
%	so there is no mapping $\map{\cdot}: \pHO \longrightarrow \spi$ that enjoys
%	the operational correspondence and full abstraction properties.
\end{proof}
