\section*{Contribution}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item	Session $\pi$ calculus with process passing.
	\item	Identify session $\pi$ and process passing subcalculi and their polyadic variances.
	\item	Bisimulation theory for higher order session semantics.
	\item	New triggered bisimulation.
	\item	Types provide techniques to prove completeness without matching.
	\item	We are interested in encodings with properties a la Gorla.
	\item	Encode session $\pi$ to pure process abstraction calculus.
	\item	Type of the recursion encoding uses non tail recursive type $\trec{t}{\btinp{t} \tinact}$.
	\item	Encode higher order semantics to first order semantics.
	\item	Negative result. Cannot encode shared names using only shared names.
\end{enumerate}
